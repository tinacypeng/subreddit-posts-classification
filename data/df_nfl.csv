nfl,,Am I the only one who thinks the SuperBowl should work like a UFC card? Where the big game is the main event and the teams that didn’t make it are the undercard.

nfl,"Hasn’t happened, since 2009.

There’s currently (13) teams allowing under 20 ppg, if the league holds steady, then this would be the most since 2006 (12) and 2005 (15)

Buffalo (13.4) and San Francisco (14.8), have a chance to finish with truly historic level defenses. It would be the first time, since 2008, the top two NFL defenses allowed under 15.0 ppg— Pittsburgh and Tennessee.  


Buffalo has a chance to have the lowest in the league, since the 2006 Baltimore Ravens. 


Both, the Bills and 49ers are playing stingy defense across the board. Each team has only (4) rushing TDs and (5) passing tds. The latter one is fairly remarkable considering the league is overwhelmingly pass-heavy.

nfl,"Dan Campbell should be fire before Jameson Williams debut. Also, the 12-month mark post ACL reconvey for Jameson Williams is around the first week of playoffs and Lions aren't making the playoffs without Jameson Williams and defense.  Therefore, Jared Goff won't play a single game with Jameson Williams this season at least. I think Lions going to tank MODE and vs. the Panthers on Christmas Eve game will determine who gets the 1st overall pick.

 Questions: At this point that we need answers:

* Can Jameson Williams be this season offensive rookie of the year?
* Is Jameson Williams an offensive comeback player of year candidate?
* Will Dan Campbell ever coach Jameson Williams?
* Is the trade from the Vikings at draft night worth it?
* Is the Lions season over?
* Will OBJ going to sign an NFL team this season (not Lions related)?
* What if Jameson Williams decided to be a fifth-year senior in 2023-24 at Alabama instead going into the 2022 draft?
* What if Jameson Williams did not tear his ACL at the College Football Playoff Championships?
* Will Jameson Williams Rookies season be like John Michie III rookie season without playing a single game with two different teams?
* Which comes first: Jameson Williams NFL debut or Dan Campbell being fire?
* When will Jameson Williams be going to starting patience?
* Is there ""hope"" for Jameson Williams NFL debut this season?
* How Lions picked Jameson Williams over defense?
* Why did the Lions pick Jameson William over Matt Corral?
* Is Dan Campbell talking about next season already?

Like many of you, I was fascinated by Russell Wilson’s Dangerwich [commercial](https://twitter.com/b_hartland/status/1574860774870228998?s=11&amp;t=p5XSXWC1h-J-KDDkd7MCXQ).  Featuring awkward pauses, fake chewing, and magically reappearing bites of sandwich, the short ad was captivatingly strange.  But what really struck me was how good the Dangerwich looked.  I’m not usually a sucker for fast food commercials, but I just couldn’t stop thinking about it.

My fellow Niner faithful may judge me for coveting a sandwich promoted by the monster who destroyed my team’s hopes and dreams for a decade by frustratingly slipping out of near-certain sacks with a seemingly oiled-up torso and then launching the ball 50 yards down the field.  But my heart wanted what it wanted.  Plus, he’s a Bronco now, so I should get a pass.

# Subway and I:

Throughout high school and into college, I experienced rather intense anxiety in unfamiliar situations.  One of these unfamiliar situations was ordering from Subway.  The first time I ordered from Subway, I was a high school sophomore.  I was travelling in a school minivan to Fresno with my cross country team on the way to the state championship race when we stopped at a Subway to get lunch.  Uh oh.  I had never ordered from Subway before, and I had no idea what to do.  I placed myself at the back of the line, and as I approached closer and closer to the counter, the more and more nervous I felt.  My turn finally arrived.  There were so many choices.  My eyes darted around scanning all the labels as my mind tried to make sense of it all.  Oh God, everyone was waiting on me and they knew I was cracking.  I quietly mumbled and bumbled my way down the assembly line, but somehow, I came away with a sandwich.  I sat down with my teammates and unwrapped my sub.  It was a six-inch untoasted wheat bread sandwich with ham and nothing else.  My friends gave me grief for my decision, but as I ate my terrible sandwich, I knew that I had survived.

A few years later, I began my Freshman year of college.  My first week, I found myself at the center of campus around lunch time, far away from my room and dining hall.  There was a food court, but all its options were unfamiliar except for Subway.  My hunger drove me towards those green and yellow neon lights, and I once again queued up at the end of the line as I tried to suppress a low but rising panic.  But this time, I listened to how people ahead of me ordered.  Aha, there was a structure to ordering.  Bread, meats, cheese, toasted or not toasted, vegetables.  I mentally prepared for my own sandwich and formulated exactly what I was going to say at each step of the process.  “Italian footlong please.  BMT please.  Swiss please.  Toasted please.  Lettuce, tomato, and cucumber please.  Thank you,” I repeated in my head, over and over again.  I was now only a few spots away from the counter.  As the Subway Sandwich Artist asked the same series questions to each person ahead of me, I would answer his questions in my head.  By the time I was finally at the front, I was ready.

Mere minutes later, I had successfully ordered my sub.  I walked away from the counter, experiencing a wave of relief followed by embarrassment that this was such a big deal to me.  Nevertheless, as I sat down and bit into my sandwich, I felt a small bit a pride.  I had made a reasonable sandwich.  I did order it without sauce though because I had forgotten to prepare for that step while in line.  In my following years at college, I would often return to that food court Subway, ordering the same sandwich every time, sometimes mentally preparing in line, and always ordering without sauce.

# Procuring the Dangerwich:

On Wednesday, I visited Subway’s online Vault menu, looking for the Dangerwich Russell had informed me of in secret.  However, to my dismay, it was no longer there.  I sighed and resigned myself to the fact that I had missed my opportunity to taste the Dangerwich’s daring dangerousness.

The next day I found that I still craved Russell’s elusive sub, and even more so now that it was the forbidden fruit that Subway was attempting to deprive me of.  I stumbled upon a list of ingredients online and realized I could custom order the Dangerwich myself.  But I didn’t want to read the ingredients off my phone because that would be embarrassing, and my Subway Sandwich Artist would think I was weird.  So, I decided to memorize the ingredients beforehand and mentally prepare for ordering my sandwich.  Fortunately, this is something I have a lot of experience with.

Before I went to bed that night, I repeated the ingredients to myself aloud until I remembered all of them without fail.  I then visualized the ordering scenario, even moving down an imaginary sandwich assembly line.  “Footlong on Italian herbs and cheese please.”  Shuffle shuffle.  “Pepperoni, salami, and black forest ham please.  Could I also get provolone cheese and add bacon to that?""  Pause.  ""Yes, toasted please.”  Pause.  Shuffle shuffle.  “Can I get lettuce, tomato, green peppers, and banana peppers please?”  Shuffle shuffle.  “And mayo and yellow mustard please.  Thanks!”

Rolling out of bed Friday morning, I again listed the ingredients aloud.  And again, as I was shaving.  And again, while preparing a light breakfast.  And again, on the drive to Subway.  And one more time, sitting in my car in the parking lot outside of the Subway.  I walked through the door, excited and ready.

The preparation paid off.  I nailed my lines and hit my marks, and I was rewarded with a custom recreation of Russell Wilson’s Subway Signature Dangerwich Sandwich.  I sat myself down on a thin 2-chair table by the window, barely wide enough for the footlong wrapper I was unfolding.  And there it was.  The Dangerwich.  The sandwich that I had spent the last few days thinking about and preparing for was right in front of me.  I picked up the right half of the sandwich and paused for a moment, realizing that the Subway’s indoor speakers were playing “Take My Breath Away.”  I took a bite.

# The Review:

The predominant flavor of the Dangerwich is the meats, particularly the pepperoni and salami.  Towards the closed edge of the sub, the meats fold onto themselves, so the meat flavor is especially strong there.  Towards the open edge of the sub, you move away from the meats a little and taste a bit more of the banana peppers and the creaminess of the mayo.  While the other vegetables don’t contribute much to the overall taste due to stronger flavors being at play, they provide a nice crunch.  I alternated bites between the open edge and closed edge, and I preferred the meatier flavor of the closed edge.

Now, you’re all asking the same question: Was it dangerous?  It certainly wasn’t dangerously spicy.  I suppose it was mildly spicy, but most of that came from the pepperoni and salami.  Every couple of bites, I took a small sip of my sweet iced tea, which washed away any sensation of spiciness from my tongue.  The banana peppers marginally contributed to the spiciness, but again, the meat did most of the work.  If you consider other types of danger such as choking on unchewed Italian Herb and Cheese bread, then I suppose that would increase the Dangerwich’s dangerousness, but that doesn’t seem fair because choking risk isn’t exclusive to the Dangerwich.

I ate ten of the sub’s twelve inches.  I was full and fairly satisfied at the end of my meal.  Although, as I got up from my table, I did feel a twinge of disappointment.  The Dangerwich was decent, but when I saw Russell Wilson take multiple first and second bites out of the sandwich in the ad, I imagined something better.  Overall though, when I exited the restaurant, I was glad I did this silly exercise.  I was also glad to see that no one had broken into my car while I was inside.  A pleasant surprise, living in the San Francisco Bay Area.

But what's score do I assign the Dangerwich?  I would like to introduce you to my Infallible 100-point Sandwich Rating Scale (I100PSRS for short).  It considers the ten major aspects of the sandwich consumption experience.  The first five aspects fall into a broad taste category and the other five aspects fall into a general experience category, with each category being worth 50 points.  Points are distributed amongst the ten aspects based on a relative importance.  I’ll provide a blank I100PSRS form in a comment below so that you too can accurately judge the sandwiches you consume.

**Sandwich Aspect Definitions and Point Values:**

* Bread *(5 pts)* – Quality of Bread
* Main Fillings *(5 pts)* – Quality of Meats/Primary Sandwich Content
* Accessory Fillings *(5 pts)* – Quality of Vegetables/Secondary Sandwich Content
* Filling Consistency *(5 pts)* – Evenness in which ingredients are spread
* Ingredient Interwork *(30 pts)* – How well ingredients complement each other and work together
* Neatness *(10 pts)* – Ease in which sandwich can be eaten without making a mess
* Mouth Feel *(15 pts)* – Texture, crunch, etc.
* Time to Order *(5 pts)* – How long it takes to order the sandwich
* Pre-meal Anticipation *(5 pts)* – Level of excitement obtained from smell, looks, etc. before eating
* Post-meal Satisfaction *(15 pts)* – Level of fullness and general happiness after eating

The below table contains my scoring for the Dangerwich.  For comparison, I included the Italian BMT I used to order in college and a McDonald’s Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese.  Due to the importance of dangerousness in this particular sandwich discussion, I added a special “Danger Bonus” worth up to five points.

|Sandwich Aspect|Dangerwich|College BMT|Dbl Qrt Pd w/ Cheese|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Bread (5 pts)|4|4|3|
|Main Fillings (5 pts)|4|4|5|
|Accessory Fill. (5 pts)|5|4|3|
|Filling Consist. (5 pts)|3|4|5|
|Ing. Interwork (30 pts)|19|17|25|
|Neatness (10 pts)|8|7|7|
|Mouth Feel (15 pts)|12|11|9|
|Time to Order (5 pts)|5|5|3|
|Pre-meal Ant. (5 pts)|5|4|3|
|Post-meal Sat. (15 pts)|9|8|14|
|Danger Bonus (+5 pts)|2|1|5 (Heart attack risk)|
|**Total**|76/100|70/100|82/100|

And there it is.  Through the Infallible 100-point Sandwich Rating Scale, I have awarded the Dangerwich **76 points** out of a possible 100.  It is better that the sandwich I typically get at Subway, but it is certainly not the best fast-food sandwich available.

## Graphs

[Here are the week's and season's results in graph form](https://imgur.com/a/wsp98f8)

The Raiders are still the most memorable team so far, having played two memorable games (both losses) and no forgettable games. The Dolphins, Chiefs, and Bills have played 2 memorable games as well.

The Panthers are the least memorable team, and they'll probably fade further into obscurity after trading Christian McCaffrey.

The AFC South and the NFC East are the least memorable divisions but for different reasons.

## Memorable Games


### Bills @ Chiefs

Is it too early to call the Mahomes-Allen rivalry the new Brady-Manning?

It seems the Bills and Chiefs are here to stay as perennial AFC powerhouses, and it helps that the last few times these teams have played they've always delivered a good game. CBS even pulled the rare move of showing this game to the entire country even though it was a 4:25 EST kickoff. If you like football, you were probably watching this game.

As for the game itself, it wasn't a ridiculous shootout like when these teams met in the AFC Divisional Round last year, but it was still very compelling Tony Romo was able to accurately predict the final score. Both offenses were able to move the ball in good chunks, like they've become accustomed to, but both QBs made crucial turnovers inside field goal range in the first half.

Amazingly, the Chiefs one-uped their famous 13-second FG-drive with 2 timeouts by scoring on a 12-second FG-drive with 1 timeout to close out the first half. It seems like McDermott cannot figure out what to do in that situation.

Nevertheless, Josh Allen and the Bills prevailed, after Allen hurdled a Chiefs defender and leading the bills to the go-ahead score, the great Bills pass defese was able to intercept Mahomes with less than a minute left to play, sealing the Bills' win.

This game will very likely have seeding implications for the AFC playoffs.

nfl,,[Set the Edge] How to Steal Millions From Those Who Need it Most: The Brett Favre Playbook
nfl,"Coming into training camp, like every season there were positive vibes and high hopes by folks in the Giants, Panthers, and Cowboys training camps about their star running backs health and outlook going forward. We had reason to be concerned about **E.Elliot**, **S.Barkley** and **C.McCaffrey** given their declines relative to their early career peaks.   

Going into the season I **analyzed the likelihood that these running backs would make it back (or reasonably close) to their peak years when they were at the top of the league.** My analysis wasn't based on each of the players specific situation, injury type, reason for decline, and outlook (I'm not that smart), it was simply a look back at all running backs who have experienced a similar statistical pattern as these three and what happened to those guys; young stars, followed by a decline earlier than expected based on their age.. 

**My criteria** 

* RB making the pro bowl before age 26 since 1978 (N = 107)
* Then I narrowed this list down by players who had a clear decline in production (injury-related or not). This took the sample size down to 35 (out of the 107)

Then I looked at what happened next and **categorized their remaining years into three categories**: a *bounce back* (at or close to their early pro bowl production), or the decline was truly the beginning of a continued *gradual decline,* or they *dropped off a cliff.* 

I also hypothesized that early draft picks would have a higher rate of bouncing back, because teams are more vested in their success and are more willing to stick with that player. The results confirmed that was the case. A team is more likely to keep trying to force a top ten pick like George Rogers to play well, than they are to stick with later round picks like Barry Foster or Rueben Mayes after a decline. 

**Overall, 31% of running backs who have a somewhat similar criteria to McCaffrey, Barkley and Elliot returned close to their early dominance for a sustained period of time. But if they were a top 10 draft pick like these three guys, they came back 71% of the time.** 

https://preview.redd.it/jbncanqqlcv91.png?width=1007&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1acc77e5ea4f256fd6fb17c8f0fc3ad20ec85a00

* Examples of guys who fit the criteria of a full bounce back: *Edgerrin James, Steven Jackson, Jerome Bettis*. 
* Examples of a continued gradual decline: *Natrone Means, Devonta Freeman, Jordan Howard*.
* Examples of an abrupt end to their career: *Jay Ajayi, Eddie Lacy, Barry Foster*.

**Caveats galore**: This is **highly subjective**. There was no formula to determine ""*bounce back*"" or ""*gradual decline*"". I **eyeballed their performance** (mostly yards from scrimmage) and made the determination. Same with the decline in production for the group of 35 decliners out of 107 running backs who made the pro bowl before age 25. My criteria for early success (pro bowl by age 25) and a decline at or before their prime (age 26 or younger) are **arbitrary**, but I thought it was a sensible way to do this. And of course, we have some real **sample size issues** in this data.

Benefits 

Ends the game faster than most options. (Reduce injury risk)

Gives advantage to team who last had the lead prior to tie. They are more likely to have possession.

Encourages going for 2 near the end of the game for the 1-point lead and avoid OT. 

Minimal reliance on coin flip for possession. 

Drawbacks

nfl,"# Brady, CMC, Deebo, Kittle, Aiyuk, Jennings. Coached by Shanahan. 

&amp;#x200B;

Brady just mentioned he has no plans to retire and I find it hard to think he stays in Tampa much longer. There were whispers even last offseason that Brady unretiring also meant possibly shipped off to the 49ers. 

49ers may have sunk cost with Lance. Brady has always wanted to play for his home area and I wager its either SF or Miami where he'd want to go next. Maybe LV with McDaniels but that's secondary. Miami is keeping Tua meaning SF is the only viable landing spot for the GOAT. If he's still the Brady of his early 40s, this could be a record breaking offense.",The 49ers could go all in for Tom Brady next offseason

nfl,"Nobody does less with more. Now I believe Brady has finally looked a bit washed but still an offense with Brady, Evans, and Godwin are struggling to even get 1st downs and at least 70% of that I believe is due to the one of the most boring, unimaginative offensive playbooks. Even the past 2 years when the offensive talent was insane, almost NOBODY was schemed open. Every single receiver + Gronk had to rely on their athleticism to win their matchups and Brady had to fit in tight windows. This should not happen for an offense with this much talent.

**The Leftwich playbook in 90% of scenarios:**

*1st and 10:* Fournette draw for 2 yards

*2nd and 8:* Hitch for 5 yards or incomplete pass

*3rd down:* Pray for Brady to bail Leftwich out which he did the past two years but not as much this year.

&amp;#x200B;

Look at last week. The Steelers were on their 4th string secondary and what is Leftwich's plan? Try to drive Fournette straight into the Steelers front seven. Evans was targeted only 4 times.

Leftwich as an OC rivals only that of Nathaniel Hackett rn for worst in the business. How any fan can consider him for a HC coach is baffling. If hired, he honestly will be on par with what we've seen with Hackett and likely without a defense as good as the Broncos to back him up.",Byron Leftwich is one of the worst offensive coordinators in all of football

The Bucs defense is one of the worst situational defenses in the league. 

They absolutely cannot be trusted in a 3rd down situation.

nfl,"This is a close derivative of the ""never had a losing season"" stat that everyone knows, but it still helps to put that accomplishment into perspective. What this means is, only one of his 15 seasons ended (in terms of playoff contention) before the final week. Here are his 5 non-playoff seasons up to this point:

- **2009**: alive heading into week 17 (albeit barely), won their game, but was eliminated 4 hours later when the Ravens won.

- **2012**: eliminated after a loss to the Bengals in week 16, thus week 17 vs the Browns was meaningless.

- **2013**: the almost-historic playoff comeback where he needed 9 results in the last 2 weeks to break his way to sneak in, and 8 of them did. As is, he was eliminated 4 hours after his last game on a missed Ryan Succop field goal.

- **2018**: the AB blowup season. Yet again he needed to win and the Ravens to lose; he won, the Ravens did not lose, and he was eliminated 20 or so minutes after his final game.

- **2019**: with a platoon of Mason Rudolph and Duck Hodges at QB, he was somehow in a position to sneak into the playoffs in week 17 provided he beats RG3-led Ravens and the Titans lost. Neither happened, so he was eliminated as soon as the whistle blew.

To be fair, this also speaks of how mediocre the middle tier of the AFC was at times - not often does a team that's 7-8 coming into week 17 still has a chance to sneak in.","Another mind-blowing Mike Tomlin stat: in the 15 full seasons he's coached, he's been in exactly one game (out of 239) that was meaningless in terms of the playoff race."

[Adjusted Games Lost](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stat-analysis/2022/agl-injury-numbers-point-ravens-rebound-2022) (AGL) is a metric created by Football Outsiders to measure the aggregate impact of injuries on a given team for a given season. They publish new data for the metric every season, so a person with too much free time can use google, inspect element, and an HTML-CSV converter to put all the data in Google Sheets.

I, my friends, am that person with too much free time. This [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1daD7BaSXtAtbk-wdUNunK_JRHcw7WCU_DaFKyi9OsRs/edit?usp=sharing) has the past decade's worth of AGL data. Feel free to play around with it. 

*Note that all credit goes to Football Outsiders; none of this is my intellectual property. I just think it's fun to check up on narratives with numbers.* 

*Also please note that, as a 49ers fan and Rams hater, this research confirms my hypothesis that I want to die. I tried to avoid letting this conclusion bias my analysis.* 

# Quick Facts

**Most-injured season in the past decade**: The **2021-22 Baltimore Ravens**. (In context, an 8-9 record for this team doesn't look too bad, huh?)

**Least-injured season in the past decade:** The **2017-18 Los Angeles Rams**. (This team went 11-5 and lost in the wildcard, wasting a truly remarkable run of health).

**Most-injured teams in the past decade:** Many teams have had bad injury luck for a couple season, but most regress to the mean eventually (around 74 AGL). Looking at the data, there are two major outliers: the **Washington Commies** (avg: \~109 AGL) and the **San Francisco 49ers** (avg: \~102 AGL). No other teams averaged even 92 Adjusted Games Lost over the past decade, making these teams true outliers. In the 49ers' case, recent seasons have dragged that average up (their 2020-21 season was the second-worst in the decade behind only the 2021-22 Ravens, and their 2021-22 season was also pretty terrible). The Redsnyders have been more consistently terrible, with jaw-droppingly bad seasons in 2013-14, 2015-16, 2017-18, and 2019-20. Trent Williams may have made a good decision to escape that medical staff (but a bad one when picking his destination; as a Niners fan, I'm not complaining).

**Least-injured teams in the past decade:** The **Los Angeles Rams** (avg: \~50 AGL) and **Atlanta Falcons** (avg: \~52 AGL) have been exceptionally good at keeping their players healthy; no other teams averaged less than 58 AGL. The Rams healthiness, of course, was punctuated by that 2017-18 season (though they've generally been solid). The Falcons also had a phenomenal 2017-18 season in terms of injuries and have also been generally solid.

It's worth noting that over this fairly large sample size of a decade, injuries don't really ""even out""; the most-injured teams have around TWICE as many games lost as the least-injured teams

# Looking At The Data

This is a graph of the every team's average adjusted games lost over the past decade:

https://preview.redd.it/5rpyq76z51v91.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a03e4be5d90de0c9c179add3680a47df8ed1057

You can see the outliers I pointed out above popping slightly at the left and right sides, with the majority of teams falling between 60-80 Adjusted Games Lost per season.

This is certainly interesting information, but most teams have had a high level of turnover in the last 10 years. Is evaluating a more recent sample more relevant? I have a graph that might help answer that.

**Recency-Weighted Average**

This graph takes an average of all 10 seasons, but weights more recent seasons more heavily. The 2021 season is ""full weight"" (1x), with the 2020 season having a weight of 0.9x, 2019 having a weight of 0.8x, 2018 having a weight of 0.7x, and so on. Is this statistically rigorous? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯, but it gives you a quick way to see the relative ""injury-proneness"" of teams with an emphasis on recent data. 

https://preview.redd.it/gijowzam71v91.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7126748c6fa9db3bbf9186c51bb85bb20f364ef7

Not much really changes! The Rams and Falcons are still the healthiest teams, and the Commandos and 49ers are still the unhealthiest. One big shift - the **Jets have gotten much worse** injury luck recently, joining the aforementioned teams in the 105+ AGL category.

What if we want to visualize the progression of teams injury frequency over time? Let's take a look at the difference between the recency-weighted and general average to see which teams have gotten better (and worse) at this in recent years:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z2p63l6691v91.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dc778d09458a10efe8bd400f3528cf6d938cd3c

On average, the league has gotten slightly worse (the average difference between the weighted and unweighted AGL/season was \~2, which means more recent years have had higher rates of injury). 

Some teams have gotten especially **worse**: the aforementioned **Jets**, of course, along with the **Broncos**, **Eagles**, **Ravens**, and (sigh) **49ers**. 

Teams that have bucked the trend with **better** injury luck recently include the **Bucs**, **Titans**, **Bills**, **Chiefs**, and **Dolphins**; perhaps not coincidentally, these franchises have broadly improved their general reputation over the past decade.

## San Francisco 49ers (3-3) @ Atlanta Falcons (3-3):

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img flqw1rmi4zu91...*

&amp;#x200B;

### 49ers O vs. Falcons D:

Let me just start this way – the Falcons deservedly won this game and I think they would have done so either way, but things could have looked very different from the start. On the initial third down of the  day for San Francisco’s offense, Jimmy G was gun-shy when he could’ve hit George Kittle for a 66-yard touchdown most likely, as they showed a  simple spacing concept out of a bunch set and I’m not totally sure if Kittle just decided to take it vertical because of something they had discussed in team meetings or if this was by design and he just got up  with the safety having outside leverage, but he ended up just throwing  that guy off himself and the deep middle safety is working his way up. So if Jimmy just steps up with plenty of green grass right in front of  him and puts it out in front, the score is 7-7. I had to smirk when I  first saw him consciously try to push the ball vertically outside the numbers when Garoppolo was first inserted for the injured Trey Lance,  but he simply puts a lid on this passing attack and makes everything feel more condensed, relying so heavily on those play-makers to create yards after the catch.

And don’t get me wrong, that’s not a bad formula, looking at the guys  they have there, but it makes things so much easier for a defense, when  they are allowed to constantly play with their eyes in the backfield and working up rather than gaining depth. You look at how aggressively Atlanta was shooting through gaps and flowing to the football, you start  to understand how they held the Niners to a season-low 50 yards on the  ground on 16 attempts. Yet, that’s when they need to be able to rely  upon Jimmy to take advantage of the space that provides his receivers to work with. Brandon Aiyuk finally had his breakout game, hauling in  eight passes for 83 and their two touchdowns. Kyle Shanahan needs to continue to utilize him as heavily, considering what he can do on designed touches, but also leaving an All-Pro corner in A.J. Terrell behind in the dust on whip routes.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Like I just said, the Falcons D played with a ton of energy and  clearly were instructed by DC Dean Pees to attack downhill as soon as they saw the O-line step forward, as well as meet pullers as early as  possible and not even allow those extra gaps to develop in the first place. When not getting called for phantom roughing the passer penalties, Grady Jarrett has been an absolute monster for this Falcons  defense, making a couple of disruptive plays every week. Something that I  hated early on in his career, when I felt like that Dan Quinn coaching staff misplaced him, due to not having anybody else to play that spot,  was lining him up a lot as the 1-technique, but it made a lot of sense  in this matchup. From there, he was able to create penetration right up the A-gap and then did a great job either riding first-year center Jake Brendel down the line on the backside or working over the top late, as  the ball-carrier approached, to hold him up.

Atlanta played a ton of single-high coverages, daring the 49ers to attack them on the perimeter, while blowing up several screen passes on the day. You like the growth these young guys are continuing to show, like Arnold Ebiketie flashing off the edge a couple of times, Troy Andersen’s speed on that second level, how those two safeties operate together. It’s a continuous process, but this was certainly encouraging going up against a very creative offensive scheme, looking at the coaching clues and ability to execute by the individual players.

&amp;#x200B;

### Falcons O vs. 49ers D:

Here’s a stat I just loved from the Falcons offense on Sunday – they used each 11, 12, 13, 21 and 22 personnel on over 10% of snaps.  They do so much window-dressing and they’re able to be very diverse regardless of personnel on the field, where they can dictate the  defensive package they’ll be facing or adjust depending on how opponents try to match them, because they can use guys like Kyle Pitts – who finally scored his first touchdown as an NFL player in the US – out wide as a legit X receiver or put him in-line and force a sub-200 pound  nickelback to fill the C-gap. Atlanta stays true to their identity, no matter who they have toting the rock. They had two rookies – fifth-round pick Tyler Allgeier and undrafted free agent Caleb Huntley – carried  the ball 15 and 16 times respectively. All those guys they have back there, especially once they get back Cordarelle Patterson, run so hard  and gain yards through contact. They’re now number three behind only the Browns and Bears with 165.2 rushing yards per game and they’ve only  failed to reach 150 once (Rams – 90).

That O-line has really impressed me with their ability to create movement laterally on wide zone schemes and their burst to secure linebackers off combos. Somebody like right tackle Kaleb McGary has gone from fringe starter to somebody they can utilize as a key piece, like they did a couple of times kicking out the corner on crack toss plays. They were able to create some favorable looks off play-action and when they did actually drop back, Arthur Smith did a great job of clearing  out the picture with motions and horizontal stretches, along with giving Mariota a back-side alert, where he can hit Drake London on back-shoulder fades, which are borderline indefensible. They also got a  couple of easy conversions with Olamide Zaccheus out in the flats, with Kyle Pitts picking for him. Plus, then off course his legs can be a big  factor, as he kept three times and was able to get around the corner – once for the touchdown to go up 21-14 just before halftime – and had a huge scramble right up the middle to convert a third-and-12.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing video zzoz5ehm4zu91...*

&amp;#x200B;

There’s really not that much to say about the 49ers defense. A couple of times early in the game, they were able to crush the pocket and take down Mariota, but they’re just banged up and were tired, with their  opponents running the ball 40 times on the day. I’m not overly concerned about anything I saw, in terms of getting blown off the ball or guys  behind the line moving themselves out of position. They did hold the Falcons to 4.2 yards per carry and below 3.5 if you take out Mariota, and it’s not like they’ll need to match full house sets with two  full-backs really in any other games this season, where we saw the Niners needing to bring out what usually are substitute players at linebacker and safety to match those. So really, Atlanta made them put guys on the field they didn’t want, because if they didn’t, that would leave sub-200 pound guys having to set the edge and things like that.

Charvarius Ward getting banged up in the first half, along with just  having lost Emmanuel Moseley for the rest of the year, forced them to put a lot of young guys on the field, when they really needed to use  their other resources to stop the run and put those guys in tough matchups. And not having Jimmie Ward right now if somebody that they  felt as well, just considering how comfortable DC DeMeco Ryans has been  with letting that other safety attack forward and how tremendous Talanoa  Hufanga has been playing with that mind-set to trigger as soon as his eyes tell him to. One of San Francisco’s two sacks was for zero yards  and then on just two of the other 54 plays they were able to create  negative yardage. Going against an offense, that is constantly ahead or at least on schedule is very hard for a defense, that wants to run a bunch of games up front and really attack upfield. Not having their best guy at setting the edge and simultaneously at turning the corner in passing situations with Nick Bosa wasn’t helpful in that regard either.

&amp;#x200B;

### Closing thoughts:

Like I mentioned, the Niners are certainly a very banged-up team, but  put some respect on Arthur Smith being able to put 21 points on them in the first half and then close out the game in the second, with one more  touchdown and a relentless run game. Marcus Mariota had an ultra-efficient day, completing 13 of 14 pass attempts for 129 yards and  two TDs, along with another 50 yards and a score on six carries. He didn’t throw the ball more than 20 times in any of Atlanta’s three wins. At a time where the NFL goes to all these three-wide receiver sets and  two-high shells defensively, they are going the exact opposite way and punishing teams for giving them favorable looks to run against. The  defense is pressuring the passer on a league-low 12.2% of dropbacks and only the Titans have recorded fewer tackles for loss (19), but Dean Pees has a great feel for when and how to change up the picture, while having everybody pursue the ball with relentless effort. I just can’t  get over how good that coaching staff has been at understanding their personnel, having a couple of new wrinkles every week for their opponents and how sound they have their guys playing.

Flipping things around, being able to overcome injuries and also  getting some of those guys back eventually on 49ers side will be key. FOX’s Sports Doc Matt currently has them dead-last in B.U.S. (banged-up score). I believe when  they get back Trent Williams at left tackle and Elijah Mitchell as  their RB1, that run game will kick into gear only more, but in matchups like this past Sunday, Jimmy G has to be able to make those big throws  down the field, which he really had one of, hitting Brandon Aiyuk with a lot of separation on a corner route to the field. Two positives for  their offense – the protection was pretty darn clean throughout the day,  allowing Jimmy G to literally hang back there at the top of his drop on several occasions, and George Kittle is back to looking like a  monster-truck rumbling through defenders in his path again. The defense will need those young corners to step up with Moseley out for the year, but I’m not concerned with some key contributors slated to return soon.

## New York Jets (4-2) @ Green Bay Packers (3-3):

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 33ixgkcv4zu91...*

&amp;#x200B;

### Jets O vs. Packers D:

I really like what offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur is doing right  now, particularly in the run game. On Sunday, you see them set up plays  with the way they threatened the edges a series of toss plays, either  cracking down with receivers in reduced splits or using guys on the move  of motion as lead-blockers. Plus, that 20-yard touchdown by Braxton  Berrios, where they pulled the guard and tight-end one way, with the  latter pivoting back around and landing the key block on the corner. And  then off that, they had a couple of really cool designs, where they  ultimately handed it to Breece, not only the long touchdown in the  fourth quarter, where they faked a reverse on a GT power play, but also  earlier in the first half, where they lined him up as the offset  receiver in a bunch set, and used the tight-end inside of him on a lead  sweep play, after faking the toss to their original side with Michael  Carter Jr.

I also loved a screen play they ran in the fourth quarter, where they  motioned the Z receiver in a two-by-two set across and showed what  looked like the trips side on a four verts concept and then got the ball  to the tight-end on the opposite side after acting like he’s in  protection, to where he had three linemen out in front, with a ton of  space. The crazy part about what the Jets have been able to do is that  second-year quarterback Zach Wilson – who I predicted to have a breakout  season – isn’t playing well at all right now. Whether it’s being a tick  late on route plays or the ball-placement being off, which was on  display on a couple of intermediate routes to the sideline, which could  have led to conversions if those passes are on the screws. And he made a  horrible decision, which almost cost them an easy field-goal, as he  threw it up into the end-zone whilst falling out of bounds on third  down, and the ball was nearly picked off.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It’s kind of been the same old story for the Packers – they can’t  stop the better run games in the league consistently. After finishing 30th  in yards allowed per carry last season, they’re right on pace yet again  at 4.7 yards per. We can go into Joe Barry’s lack of willingness to  drop one of his safeties down into the cadence of the quarterback, maybe  blitz the run more on early downs and other factors, but really what it  comes down to is that their individual players in the box have to play  better. That’s highly disappointing, considering their nose-tackle and  two linebackers earn in the double-digit millions per year, plus they  just drafted two guys from Georgia’s historically great defense in the  first round. Quay Walker in particular has been a complete liability  against the run, with a PFF run-defense grade of 29.9 – and Rashan Gary  is actually the only player in the front-seven with a grade of 70+. As a  unit, the defense is the worst in the league in terms of EPA allowed  per rush in two-high looks, which their DC seems to have no concern  living in, because that’s what he believes in schematically.

We did finally see him allow Jaire Alexander to play more press-man  coverage, even though he was going up against the Z on the field side  more regularly, and he locked up guys like Corey Davis and Garrett all  day long. They didn’t nearly do a good enough job of beating blockers to  the spot, to funnel the ball back towards their team-mates or replacing  those guys when necessary, frequently allowed the Jets to get to the  perimeter. And then off that, even when New York used soft play-action  fakes from the gun, there were some wide open passing lanes over the  middle, as Walker had followed pulling linemen and the safeties were  kind of frozen at their spots.

&amp;#x200B;

### Packers O vs. Jets D:

Green Bay tried so hard to get out to the edges with wide zone and  toss plays against a team with great speed on the second level and more  than willing tacklers on the perimeter. They had their most success in  that regard handing the ball to A.J. Dillon from the shotgun on power or  trap plays, when the defense was in that wide-nine front and playing  the pass. And their backs should have hit those cutbacks more regularly,  looking at how hard the backside linebacker chased on lateral run  schemes. Aaron Jones once did and ripped off a big chunk, but Elgton  Jenkins was called for pretty much a panic hold. When they did drop  back, it was a ton of quick game and West Coast concepts, which nobody  was able to really create any clear windows with early separation  against man and then against zone, they basically got no yardage after  the catch.

Due to that, the Packers got to third down 19(!) times in this game,  with eight of those for seven or more yards. Other than three first  downs gifted to them by penalties, they went 4-of-16. I’ll get to what  the Jets did up front in a second here, but when Rodgers actually needed  to read the field and work through progressions, he never really felt  comfortable behind his O-line, to allow things to develop down the  field, where he doesn’t trust those young guys and would rather hold  onto the ball an extra beat, to see them work their way open. At this  point, it’s also hilarious how you can count on Rodgers taking a deep  shot, whenever the other team put together a longer (scoring) drive. And  those balls aren’t bad, but he doesn’t really have a guy who will make  those plays for him on the back-end regularly.

For the Jets, Sauce Gardner has transformed what they are on the  back-end, with the physicality he brings and the confidence the coaching  staff and he himself have in the number four overall pick. They can  leave him one-on-one with the X receiver consistently and have been  playing man-coverage on third down as much as any other unit in the  league, allowing with the team speed they have to shut everything down  to the edges or thrown in front of him. You combine that with all the  games they run on the D-line, with as many variatons of picks, stunts,  twist, etc. as you can imagine, to where they realized like a quarter  into Sunday to stop blitzing. They pressured Rodgers on a season-low  percentage of dropbacks, but they sacked him four times, routinely made  the walls around him close in and the Packers O-line was called for  holding twice.

Multiple times you’d see Rodgers try to step into creases like you’d  see on a pocket presence drill, but exactly there a delayed looper would  show up. Quinnen Williams was a monster, looking like the number one  overall prospect I had him as in the 2019 draft, crashing across the  face of offensive linemen and dominating every solo-block he went up  against basically. One more player I want to shout out – I just love  watching Jordan Whitehead charge up the alley in the run game and what  he provides buzzing down, to blow up blockers, which has allowed Gang  Green to be one of four defenses to surrender less than four yards per  carry, despite losing their best run-defender from a year ago in  nose-tackle Folorunso Fatukasi. Having that quasi plus-one in the box,  even though the offense largely can’t account for it, has been key in  that regard.

&amp;#x200B;

### Closing thoughts:

The development of this Jets defense is the biggest talking point  here, closely followed by how capped this Packers offense feels like  right now. This is the type of unit I envisioned when Robert Saleh came  to New York, as they finally have all the pieces in place, whether it’s  the young guys finding their ways or veterans being healthy. And then I  like what Mike LaFleur has built in the run game. If they can Zach  Wilson to get the ball out a touch quicker and a couple inches further  towards where his receivers are heading, they can play the kind of  complete football to beat pretty much anybody. However, let’s not gloss  over the fact that Wilson had 110 yards passing and the offense went  1-of-11 on third downs for the day. They won’t have a punt blocked for a  touchdown every week. So far they’ve only played the Dolphins once at  home from their division – who they beat up pretty good. They’ll have  plenty of chances to prove themselves still.

For Green Bay, for how much they want to play two-high coverages,  they simply don’t have the guys in the front-seven, to keep opponents  behind the chains and eliminate explosives on the ground. They have the  corners to take risks with being vulnerable outside and use those other  resources to spill and fill. While offensively, I don’t see much of a  solution with the personnel they have there right now. Rodgers has that  ability to identify spatial advantages and get the ball out in a hurry,  but if those receivers don’t create that quick separation like Davante  Adams was able to or make something happen with it, if they do catch the  ball, you will get to third-and-long – and then I don’t fully trust the  receivers or O-line respectively to make the right route adjustments on  the fly or hold up long enough in pass-pro, if Rodgers has to pull the  ball down. I’d really like to see them move Elgton Jenkins back to right  guard, where he’s been an All Pro selection, and then try Yosh Nijman  or one of their rookies at tackle next to him, where they can chip and  slide that way, to help, now that David Bakhtiari is back on the  blindside. And as it sounds like their QB is desperate for, they need to  make some kind of move at receiver.

## Baltimore Ravens (3-3) @ New York Giants (5-1):

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img b0gvrdiz4zu91...*

&amp;#x200B;

### Ravens O vs. Giants D:

This is probably the game I have the least to write about, because I  really felt like the Ravens were in control for most of the day, yet  they gave away another multi-score lead and the Giants just kept hanging  around and making the plays needed to be victorious at the end.

Looking at the Ravens rushing success in this game, it really was all  Lamar Jackson keeping the ball around the corner or pulling and going  downhill on invert veer concepts. As far as their bnacks are converted,  power schemes were by far the most effective for them, either pulling  the backside guard and tackle or having the fullback kick-out the  end-man at the line of scrimmage and making the guard lead up into the  hole. Kenyan Drake had 76 yards and a touchdowns on six of those alone.  J.K. Dobbins unfortunately didn’t look like himself from a couple of  years ago, trying to bubble around traffic and trying to delay things  near the point of attack. He finished the day with seven carries for  just 15 yards (and no catches).

Baltimore lived in 21 personnel for the majority of this contest,  with fullback Patrick Ricard playing an absurd 76% of offensive snaps – a  fullback, in the 21st century. And the cool thing about them  is that you see them line up in an offset I-formation from the pistol  and run dive option one play and they motion into empty with Ricard at  tight-end as a chip-and-release guy, giving Lamar a clear picture as  they spread out the defense, while they have to match with base  personnel and can afford Lamar solid protection. And something I liked  as well in that regard was the way they’d use their backs to clear out  space to work over the middle of the field for Mark Andrews, at times  off motions or creating four-strong looks.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing gif d0k4e52f8zu91...*

&amp;#x200B;

Wink Martindale had a few really fun wrinkles incorporated into the  game-plan, like on the final play of Baltimore’s opening drive, when  they wanted to run their patented counter bash concept with Lamar and  the Giants had basically had three guys just standing behind the other  over the c, enter before going different ways at the snap and blowing up  the play, because the O-line wasn’t sure who they were responsible for,  making Lamar try to reverse field and ultimately get taken down for a  big TFL, which pushed them out of field goal range. In the pass game,  the G-Men ran some intricate games up front, including some layered  three-man stunts, where they made it almost impossible for the Ravens  O-line to pick it up, with a late looper coming free.

Looking at the box score, Mark Andrews was the only consistent target  in the pass game for Baltimore, catching seven passes for 106 yards and  a touchdown. No other Ravens player had more than three catches or 30  yards. However, that 12-yard score – which was a perfect ball by Lamar  on a slot fade route – was the only ball they allowed the tight-end to  grab over the final 26 minutes, as Wink started to play primarily  one-robber, where they’d have a guy carrying Andrews vertically with  outside leverage and dropped the safety to that side down, to take away  that inside access towards the middle. Fifth overall pick Kayvon  Thibodeaux did a great job on a couple of plays, forcing Lamar to hand  the ball off and then corralling the back. Julian Love had some  excellent reps in coverage, one-on-one against Mark Andrews and covering  ground as a deep zone defender, to disrupt the catch point, allowing  that game-turning pick off Lamar, that set up the G-Men to take their  first lead of the game with just two minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

### Giants O vs. Ravens D:

Similar to what I said about the Falcons near the top of the article –  the Giants coaches understand the personnel they have to work with.  They simply don’t have any complete receivers that they can rely upon,  to consistently create separation in his matchups, in order to work  those. But they have a special talent in Saquon Barkley, who they  understood the Ravens would always have most eyes on and opened up  opportunities for his teammates to make plays. He did touch the ball 25  times on the day, to keep their opponents honest, but he was really more  so a decoy. Rookie receiver Wan’Dale Robinson gave Big Blue a nice  spark and found the end-zone for the first time as a pro, on a little  pick play to the flats, but we saw them use a ton of 12 and some 21  “pony” personnel on the day (their wildcat package with two tailbacks),  because Brian Daboll probably feels like they can be the most diverse  out of those.

You see some play-designs that nobody else in the league has run this  season. I put a clip here of this play they ran on their first  touchdown drive midway through the second quarter, where they were in 31  personnel with three actual tailbacks, fake the dive with the deep back  and put Daniel Jones on the move of this front-side bootleg, where he  has Saquon out in the flats and Matt Breida wheeling up the sideline. He  hit the latter, as the safety to that side tried to take away Barkley  underneath, for 15 yards. And as much as people want to crap on Daniel  Jones – which has been fair at points – he delivered some crucial plays  on third downs, going 7-of-11 on the day, with conversions of 14, 12 and  a touchdown. They hit some deep crossers to extend drives and some of  other cool designs in the pass game, throughout the day, where they used  the eyes of Ravens defenders being on Barkley against them.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing gif c56ts35g8zu91...*

&amp;#x200B;

Baltimore’s defense for the majority of the day was able to hold  Saquon Barkley in check. He had just 95 yards on those 25 touches, with  none of them going for more than eight yards. That was thanks to having  the guys on the interior to hold up against double-teams on more  vertical run schemes and great pursuit whenever he was threatening out  to the edges. However, while they did get some good hits on Daniel Jones  in the pocket, he deserves credit for standing tall to deliver the  ball, while those DBs on the back-end couldn’t plaster the receivers  quite well enough to avoid that little bit of late separation. And right  now, other than Justin Madubuike knifing through a couple of times per  game, they don’t have anybody who can consistently win his pass-rush  reps one-on-one.

Patrick Queen got close to Jones on a couple of wrap-around blitzes,  where they could have gotten the Giants off the field on third downs,  but both Barkley and Breida had tremendous pass-pro reps, allowing their  quarterback to step into the throw and deliver big conversions.  Baltimore is tied for the third-most takeaways in the league (12) and  one of only four teams with at least one of those in each of their six  games. They got another in this contest, but that strip-sack on the  final play before halftime was pretty much meaningless. The only big one  they nearly had came at the two-minute warning at the end of the game,  when Marcus Peters was called for pass interference in the end-zone, and  Saquon scored on a goal-line leap on the very next snap.

&amp;#x200B;

### Closing thoughts:

This is now their third loss this season after leading by  double-digit points in the fourth quarter. And once again, there were  way too many costly mistakes. Up 7-0, they have the Giants stopped on a 3rd-and-4,  with a screen to Richie James coming a yard short, but John Harbaugh  decides to push New York back ten yards on an offensive pass  interference call, only for them to convert on a deep curl to Darius  Slayton. Lamar missed Devin Duvernay for a touchdown right after the  two-minute warning in the first half, who had a step on the safety on a  corner-route in the high red-zone, and then put it out maybe a couple of  inches too far him on a drag route early on in the second half. They  ended up settling for field goals on both of those drives. Then up by  three, with as many minutes left on a third-and-one, they get called for  an illegal formation on what would have been a conversion on a QB  sneak, and they have that odd snap exchange on the very next snap, where  the ball goes through Lamar’s hands, but instead of throwing it away as  they running out to the sideline, he goes back across his body and gets  picked off by Julian Love. Marcus Peters get called for pass  interference on third-and-goal, where the receiver tried to push off and  his reaction was to grab cloth, before Saquon leaps over the top of the  pile, to put the Giants up by four. And finally, Lamar gets  strip-sacked by Thibodeaux, to seal the deal. Oh, and Justin Tucker  missed a 56-yard field goal attempt at the end of the second drive on  the day, which is also very uncommon. Those are simply way too many  miscues in a game that they should have really won.

The Giants on the other hand continue to play clean football  throughout and particularly in late-game situations. It sounds like a  stupid cliché, but they simply don’t beat themselves, but rather wait  for the opponent to make those mistakes. On their final four  possessions, they scored a field goal and two touchdowns, plus then they  were able to run out the clock, with Saquon making the right decision  for his team to win, as he slid down at the two-yard line instead of  scoring – to the chagrin of several fantasy managers of his, like  myself. You can argue right now New York’s coaching staff is doing as  good a job of maximizing the talent at their disposal as any group in  the league. They play tough, smart old-school football, where they allow  their personnel to dictate what they can run, but then dictate to the  opposing team what they can run in those situations. If there’s one  thing I’d like to do them still, it’s adding a speed-element to that  receiving corp, to open up more space underneath for themselves. I don’t  want to rule out a “homecoming” for Odell Beckham Jr.

## Buffalo Bills (5-1) @ Kansas City Chiefs (4-2):

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img j9fq51m35zu91...*

&amp;#x200B;

### Bills O vs. Chiefs D:

The one overarching point for Buffalo’s offense on Sunday was how  they didn’t allow Chiefs DC Steve Spagnuolo to dictate the game to them  with a bunch of exotic pressures and forcing Josh Allen to throw it hot.  And they largely did so with multiple tight-ends and/or backs, forcing  Kansas City to match with base personnel. Fullback Reggie Gilliam was on  the field for 29% of snaps on Sunday – the highest mark since  their blowout win at the Rams in the season-opener, where they just  closed out the game running the way. Plus, they were in 12 personnel for  seven snaps in this contest, when they have used it just five times all  season heading into the day. That allowed them to create favorable  angles with cross-blocks by the O-line and using the fullback or inserts  by the TEs as lead-blocks, where Devin Singletary is really good at  partially hiding behind that guy in the hole and forcing the defender to  commit to one side, before slicing up the other way. They used some  counter action in the backfield, with the guard wrapping around from the  backside and the RB getting behind him. And once they showed  pin-and-pull run action one way out of an Ace set (with TEs on either  end of the line) and used center Mitch Morse pivoting back the other way  to lead-block for Singletary on a pitch out to the weak-side edge,  which unfortunately was taken off due to a holding call on the wide  receiver to that side, but it was a really cool design and they had the  defense totally fooled. Even taking away Josh as a runner, they ran the  ball the ball 19 times for 93 yards, with Singletary handling all but  two of those.

Something I loved when they were in 21 personnel was being able to  line up in singleback with an Ace Duo set (the FB and TE to the right),  with the Chiefs being in a true 4-3 front, because they were matching  that package, expecting run. Instead, Buffalo ran play-action and had  both the slot receiver away from the strength of the formation off a  scissors concept and the back-side dig wide open, because they faced a  simple cover-three and that second level wasn’t even close to crowding  those passing windows in any way. Allen showed the maturity to routinely  throw it to Devin Singletary in front of the linebackers (largely off  play-fakes) with the Chiefs playing two-high shells. Understanding what  they were facing from a coverage perspective allowed them to understand  how to create challenges for the defense, along with sprinkling in some  seven-man pass-pro when they needed to block it up in situations, where  they expected Spags to bring pressure. They also had the receivers to  take advantage of those young corners being forced onto the field for  KC, such as Gabe Davis on that 34-yard touchdown just before the half,  running right by his guy on a fade route, having the chemistry with  Stefon Diggs to be in sync on those secondary route adjustments, and  Allen making some bat-shit throws, like when they were pinned inside  their own one-yard line on third-and-13, where the QB dipped underneath  the edge rusher and almost side-armed the ball on a rope to Davis on  sitting down a deep dig, along with multiple sick side-line shots  against a two-deep coverage.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing video qaeotft45zu91...*

&amp;#x200B;

Once again, Kansas City not being able to dictate terms defensively  on many snaps certainly became a big factor. They did end up blitzing on 34.9% of Josh Allen’s dropbacks, but only pressured him on 11.4% total. It really only was only a factor in third and fourth  downs, where the Bills went five-of-14 on the day. Using the pro  personnel on the offensive side largely put the Chiefs in zone coverage  and they used more sets with three than one (off-ball) linebacker.  That’s not what we’re used to from Spaguolo in terms of the  aggressiveness as a play-caller, where early on in this growing rivalry,  they’d bring pressure spread across all three downs and forced Josh to  throw hot, while having guys in the back-seven, who understand where  that would lead the ball to go to then.

When Spags did have the chance to bring heat in obvious passing  situations against 11 personnel, he was able to scheme open a free  rusher and multiple times peeled off the D-end to take the back, whilst  playing tight man-coverage on the four other eligible receivers. They  had two great back-to-back plays like that at the tail-end of Buffalo’s  third possession of the day, as they brought Juan Thornhill untouched on  a weak-side B-gap blitz by occupying the five blockers, plus a  linebacker coming through the opposite B-gap, as the right tackle had to  set to the wide end, not expecting him to bail out again. Josh Allen  had to release the ball whilst fading away from the rush on both of  them, once throwing the ball into the stomach of Chris Jones just  playing with his eyes up the whole way, when he had Singletary open on  an angle route, and then putting it slightly behind Isaiah McKenzie on a  quick in-breaker as the number two, where they picked off the slot  defender with Diggs running a corner route. The receiver could have  potentially pulled that one in, if he didn’t jump, but he had an  extremely rough day altogether.

&amp;#x200B;

### Chiefs O vs. Bills D:

Buffalo certainly showed more of a commitment to running the ball  than Kansas City, as Patrick Mahomes accounted for 21 of their 68  rushing yards on the day – all on scrambles – and their backs averaged just 3.6 yards a pop. Outside of using a split backfield with their fullback to one side of the quarterback and rolling Mahomes the other  way of a lead play to slow down the pursuit, they didn’t have many  wrinkles in the ground game, to give them those schematic advantages.  For them it was more so about RPOs and screens to their backs, to make  them a factor, where on the former they used slide routes by Kelce, glances and back-shoulder fade alerts on the outside to give themselves  options. They also had a really fun design on a TE screen to Noah Gray, where they faked a flat screen to the three-receiver side and released  the back wide the other way, with Gray pivoting around underneath that, to get in behind three linemen. If not for Bills LB Tremaine Edmunds being a freak of nature and chasing him down from the backside, he may rip off a huge play on that one.

They are already expected to make a couple billion dollars off of betting agreements. We are seeing more and more absurd calls occurring at increased frequency unlike ever before and it is starting to seem suspicious now that the NFL is itself in cahoots with betting organizations. I believe this could be a reason why instead of modifying roughing the passer the NFL has actually doubled down on the decision to leave it very vague and open for a penalty. If they NFL actually cared about keeping quarterbacks safe and allowing the game to be played QBs would be subject to 2-hand touch or they would wear flags on their hips instead.",NFL is getting suspicious.

Who would of thought the most entertaining part of a Denver Broncos primetime game would be a [Commercial Counter](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/147yAWKBby2T-NUvLqgwoJNtaA1fYG66pUoVgXUHIPx8/edit?usp=sharing)? I count commercials and I track the time and how many non-local commercials there are during the primetime games and post weekly updates!

***NFL COMPARSION STATS***

* We have watched more hours of Denver Broncos Non-Commercial Time in Primetime Games (9) than Broncos have total touchdowns (7).
* There were more non-local commercials in the DEN-LAC game (87) than the Chargers had total rushing yards this week (73).
* The 5-1 Giants have only been in 1 primetime game, where they aired 114 non-local commercials, if we put that in as receiving yards, they would be 5th most for the Giants.
* There were more non-local commercials in the 2nd Half/Overtime in the DEN-LAC game (40) than Russell Wilson had yards in the 2nd Half/Overtime (15).
* Josh Allen has more total yards (2,237) than Total Non-Local Commercials (1,944)

*NOTE: The 51 non-local commercials and 20:23 2nd Quarter was record highs for Commercial Counter History. That being said, find it funny that they ""apologized"" with a season low 2nd Quarter the next game. That 9:33 in the 2nd Quarter is the only time this season to have less than 10 minutes of commercial time in the 2nd Quarter. Also, the 3:36 of WAS vs CHI Halftime Commercial Time had to do with ""The Pile On"" not being a technical commercial, but I really should of counted it.*

nfl,"#What is passing Net Yards over Average (pNYoA)? 

It is the total additional or fewer passing yards a QB earns when comparing each pass attempt at the respective down, distance, and field position to the league average over the last five seasons. Minimum 100 pass attempts .

e.g. If the league average pass attempt on first and 10 at the 50 yard line is 7.5 and a QB throws a pass attempt on 1st and 10 from the 50 that gains 12 yards the QB would earn a +4.5 for the throw.

Let's be honest we're all just going to scroll to our own QBs to see if this chart fits our own narratives.

Hello everyone!

We're back for week 6 of Memorability Rankings.

According to some feedback, I'm changing the name of the lowest tier of game from ""not worth watching"" to ""forgettable."" The point of this change is to emphasize that a game doesn't necessarily need to be good to be memorable, as the Broncos have shown time and time again this season.

Thanks for participating.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Criteria

The criteria I came up with is as follows:


##1. **Forgettable**
Essentially, nothing of note in the grand scheme of things happened. Only fans on the winning team will care about this game in 8 months and even they might have already forgotten what happened. A boring game.


##2. **Regular game**
Most games should land in this ranking. Some players had a good statistical performance and there was some good football worth watching. But at the end of the day, it doesn’t stand out when comparing with other games.


##3. **Memorable game**
This game will be remembered throughout the season with most fans easily being able to recall several plays and moments from the game. It helps if the game has a strong narrative attached to it or if it happened in primetime. The exact same game is more memorable if played in the Divisional Round as opposed to at 1pm EST with Andrew Catalon and Spero Dedes. Games with a crazy finish, huge upsets, and amazing plays. Some examples of games fit for this category:

- Josh Allen hurdles Vikings defenders in huge upset
- Bears ruin Brett Favre night in Lambeau
- Antonio Brown extends at the goal line against the Ravens
- Nick Foles throws 7 touchdowns
- Niners win the division by stopping the Seahawks one yard short
- Colts lose to Jags on clown day to miss the playoffs
- Rodgers throws 2 Hail Marys and Fitzgerald goes crazy in overtime
- Seahawks tie Cardinals 6-6 in wacky game


##4. **Hall of Fame**
A game that will still be brought up in decades. NFL fans will easily remember this game in 10 years. Non-NFL fans might have even heard of this game. You barely need more than 2 words for people to know what game you’re talking about. Again, if the game happens during the Super Bowl, it’s more memorable than if it happens in week 4. Some examples:

- 28-3
- Immaculate reception
- DIGGS!
- Helmet Catch
- The Catch
- The Drive
- 13 seconds

Voting ends Friday afternoon.

nfl,"In 2018, the Chiefs and Rams played in one of the greatest NFL games of all time, ending with an insane final score of 54-51.

Every year since, there has always been at least one game that has seen both teams score almost as many points and stand out compared to all other games that year in terms of intensity, just like the Chiefs-Rams game.

In my opinion, the successors of the Chiefs-Rams game from 2019 to 2021 (as 2022 is still ongoing) are:

&amp;#x200B;

2019: The 49ers-Saints game. Both teams were fighting for dominance of the NFC (and the Packers were there too, I guess), and once these two high-flying offenses met it was a bloodbath. The defense was non-existant, but the Saints would've gotten the win were it not for George Kittle's monstrous drive down the field that put the 49er's in field goal range to win the game 49-46, which proved crucial in letting the 49er's get the #1 seed.

&amp;#x200B;

2020: The Browns-Ravens game. Poop jokes aside, this match that initially seemed like Baltimore had it in the bag soon turned into a slobberknocker following Lamar's bowel issues, with both teams' defenses going into the toilets as the Browns crapped out TD's to narrow the score. However, the return of Lamar plus Justin Tucker's OP kicking let them barely win 47-42, despite a wild last-ditch effort by the Browns at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

2021: The Bills-Chiefs NFC Championship. It doesn't get much better than this, and despite the ""low"" score of less than 80 combined points, that doesn't do justice to the intensity and wildness of this match. The fact that a coin decided the winner showed the sheer talent of both Mahomes and Allen, leading to the true start of what will no doubt be one of football's best QB rivalries. 

&amp;#x200B;

So far as of 2022 I can't seem to find any match that fits this due to all the chaos and sloppy performances from usually-good teams.

#What is ANY/A and why does this matter?

ANY/A is a QB statistic which correlates extremely well with wins. Aside from EPA/play (which as far as I’m aware is much harder to calculate as an individual, I think it’s the best available (to us plebeians, that is). Its full name is Adjusted Net Yards per Attempt, and it’s basically a modification of yards per attempt in the following manner:

&gt; (20 x TDs + passing yards - 45 x INTs - sack yards)/(pass attempts + sacks)

A higher number is better.

Is it perfect? No, obviously not. It doesn’t account for a lot of things, like fumbles and rush yards and pick sixes and several other things like torrential rain games which skew stats in weird directions, but it is a pretty good stat and is not too terribly difficult to calculate by hand.

ANY/A is often computed over at least several games, but most often over a season or career. This is because it’s very prone to volatility. As you’ll see below, QBs can put up ANY/As in a single game that can be far better or worse than their career ANY/A.

So, why should you care about this? Frankly, if you don’t care than feel free to ignore this post. I just like statistics and thought it was be interesting to put up. But my argument for it is that even at a small sample size, the larger ANY/A in a game seems to win a lot. So maybe it’ll give you one more aspect you can pay attention to in a football game.

With all that being said, here’s the data I’ve accumulated.

#Data Table

Mitch Trubisky | 12.15 | A

#Grades

Now, what are those little letters listed after the ANY/A? Well, those are my grades.

Before you start screaming at me about your favorite player’s grade, let me just say that that it isn’t just random where the cutoffs are. Specifically:

&gt; An A grade corresponds to a single-game ANY/A greater than or equal to 10.

&gt; A B grade corresponds to a single-game ANY/A greater than or equal to 7.5, but less than 10.

&gt; A C grade corresponds to a single-game ANY/A greater than or equal to 4.5, but less than 7.5.

&gt; A D grade corresponds to a single-game ANY/A greater than or equal to 2, but less than 4.5

&gt; An F grade corresponds to a single-game ANY/A less than 2.

Now, these grades aren’t like those in school, where the average ends up usually being a B, and vert few people get D’s and F’s. This is a curve where the average is intended to be a straight C. Similarly, the vast majority of single-game performances also are intended to a C, because C’s should be enough to be competitive in most games. As such, B’s and D’s are somewhat unusual but not extraordinarily so, and F’s and A’s are extraordinary games, for either good or bad reasons.

**Note that single-game ANY/As do not necessarily match up with season-long and career-long ANY/As. Single-game ANY/As are much, much more volatile and will yield a much larger spread than a typical season-long ANY/A spread. For that reason, you cannot treat them the same as you would a season-long ANY/A, where an exceptional, MVP-caliber season would be an 8+ ANY/A. It’s kind of like the PFF system, where a lot of consistently good performances will get you a higher grade than one great performance and a bunch of mediocre performances.**

Well then, what do the grades mean? While they are certainly somewhat subjective, this is what I intended them to represent:

&gt; A: This grade represents an exceptional game through the air. This performance was nearly flawless and is incredibly difficult to replicate game in and game out. It’s nearly unsustainable, even for the best QBs. There should be no more than a few of these per week. A string of these would probably result in the greatest season of all time.

&gt; B: This grade represents an excellent game through the air. While some mistakes were present, the good vastly outweighs the bad. These are certainly more sustainable than the A-graded games, and the best QBs can sometimes have these games for long stretches at a time. A lot of these games will probably put you in the MVP race, and there should be a handful of these per week.

&gt; C: This grade represents a mediocre or satisfactory game. There were mistakes and success, but neither vastly outweighed the other. This kind of performance will put most teams in contention to win most games, and the majority of QBs in a week will have this kind of performance. 

&gt; D: This grade represents a bad game. Many mistakes were made, enough so that they significantly outweighed the successes. A team with a QB playing like this will be hard-pressed to win games, and if your QB is playing like this often, it’s probably time to look for a replacement. There should t be too many of these per week, but there should definitely be some.

&gt; F: This grade represents a terrible game. The QB had essentially none or very few positives throughout the game, far outweighed by the negatives. With this kind of performance, it’s almost impossible to win a game. A string of these warrants a benching almost immediately. Just like for the A’s, there should only be a couple of these per week at the most.

My opinion is that my cutoffs do represent these grades well. The vast majority of grades fall between B and D, with the most in C, and A’s and F’s are few and far between. I didn’t just throw darts at a board either, I spent quite a few weeks looking at the numbers before coming up with these cutoffs, sometime last year (unfortunately I do not remember exactly when). Obviously you can always make slight changes here and there, but I’ve been using this system for a while and it’s easier for me to keep using it than to do some statistics with standard deviations and percentages and the like and figure out what the perfect cutoffs would be. [And actually, most of the time, these track pretty well with the idea of standard deviation - usually the number of C’s is pretty close to the amount within a single standard deviation of the mean, and usually there are only a couple A’s and F’s, which are ideally meant to be outside 2 standard deviations from the mean. While this hasn’t been numerically tested or anything, I feel pretty good about it in general].

If you don’t like them even after this explanation, feel free to ignore them. I just made them for fun anyway.

#Tl;dr

ANY/A is a QB stat that tracks well with wins; larger is better. This includes a list of the single-game ANY/A for any QB who played *significant snaps* (aka not garbage time only) this week. There are attached grades which are somewhat arbitrary (I set the cutoffs once in the past but I don’t make changes to grades arbitrarily) but I think they make sense and fit my goal, but if you don’t like them feel free to ignore them.","Single-game ANY/As for QBs that saw significant snaps, Week 6"

I hate to beat a dead horse, but just to grab the most repeated sentiment about the league right now. 

* Vikings are 5-1, everyone says they aren't as good as their record suggests, and it shows it on here, where they're 5th in ESPNs power rankings, tied for 2nd in the NFC, yet the power index has them at 13th or ""half a point per game"" better than average.
* Giants are 5-1, people say the same about them, tied for 2nd in the NFC, 5th in power rankings, yet 21st or 1.5 points worse than average per game on here.

The ones that I wanted to see if anyone could help better explain to me how they got it is these wild outliers.

* The Raiders at 8th
*  The Jaguars at 9th
* The Bucs as the *3rd best team in the league* 
* The Packers at 6th.

&amp;#x200B;

 It seems like this holds a lot of weight on who a teams quarterback is, doesn't it? But then that wouldn't explain why the Raiders or Jaguars are so high. 

&amp;#x200B;

Appreciate any insight on it the only insight I'd rather not bother with is the low hanging ""it's espn so its trash""",ESPN's NFL Football Power Index; can someone who might know more help me better understand how they get these numbers?

nfl,"My team's gone cold I'm wondering why I

Left the Seahawks at all

The primetime game clouds up my stat sheet

And I can't seem to ball

And even if I could it'll all be gray

Put your picture on my wall

It reminds me, that it's not so bad

It's not so bad

&amp;#x200B;

Dear Geno, I wrote you but you still ain't callin'

I left my cell, my twitter, and my agent's number at the bottom

I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em

There probably was a problem at the front office or somethin'

Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em

But anyways, fuck it, what's been up? Man how's your jaw been?

My wide receivers are great too, I'm bout to be a baller

If I ever win a game, guess what I'm a holler?

""Bronco's country, let's ride""

I read about your safety Jamaal too I'm sorry

I had a teammate injure himself and miss a couple ballgames

I know you probably hear this everyday, but you're better than Big Truss

I even got your Jets jersey from they called you a bust

I got a room full of your posters and your pictures Cuz

I liked when you said ""you ain't write back"", that shit was fat

Anyways, I hope when you read this you don't think it's sus

Just wanna chat, truly yours, your biggest fan

This is Russ

&amp;#x200B;

Dear Geno, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance

I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans

If you didn't wanna talk to me after the game

I think that's kinda bull, but you coulda signed an autograph for Nathaniel

That's my new coach man he's only 6 games old

We waited in the blistering cold for you

For four hours and you just said, ""No.""

That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol

He wants a QB like you man, he likes you more than I do

I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to

Remember when I left for Denver, you said if I'd write you you would write back

See I'm just like you in a way

I never got approval from Pete

He used to always run on 3rd down and not let me compete

I can relate to what you're saying in interviews

So when I have a shitty game, I drift away and watch the news

'Cause I don't really have good games so that shit helps when I'm depressed

I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest

Sometimes I even fake an injury to see if fans believe

It's like adrenaline, the lies are such a sudden rush for me

See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it

Ciara's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7

But she don't know you like I know you Geno, no one does

She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up, you gotta call me bruh

I'm crying on the bus, in the back trying to hide

Sincerely yours, Russ

P.S. Broncos country, let's ride

&amp;#x200B;

My team's gone cold I'm wondering why I

Left the Seahawks at all

And I can't seem to ball

It reminds me, that it's not so bad

It's not so bad

&amp;#x200B;

Dear Mister ""I'm too good to call or write my fans"",

This will be the last package I ever send your ass

It's been six games and still no word, I don't deserve it

I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect

So this is my Tiktok I'm sending you, I hope you hear it

I'm on Twitter right now, defending myself on a burner

Hey Geno, I took some HGH,

You dare me to test?

You know those old rumors that the internet and Florio spread?

About that QB who could have left Seattle for a big market team like the Jets?

But didn't, then Geno wound up starting in Seattle as a vet?

That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from the Broncos

Now it's too late, I've read a thousand tweets and I'm down bad bro

And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call

I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall

I love you Geno, we coulda been together, think about it

You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it

And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it

I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me

See Geno, shut up coach! I'm tryin' to talk!

Hey Geno, that's my coach screamin' in the locker room

But I didn't leave him on read, I wrote back, see I ain't like you

'Cause if he's here for the whole season he'll lose more, and then he'll get fired too

Well, gotta go, halftime is almost over now

Oh shit, I'm lost, Mr. Unlimited is having doubts!

&amp;#x200B;

Dear Russ, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy

You said your wide receivers are balling out, how much yardage they getting?

Look, I think it's really cool that you've got a catch phrase

And here's an autograph for your coach

I wrote it on my stat page

I'm sorry I didn't see you at the game, I must've missed you

Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you

But what's this shit you said about you like to fake injuries?

You need to own your mistakes dog, come on, you make me worry

You got some issues Russ, I think you need some counseling

To help your ass from throwing errant balls when you get down some

And what's this shit about us meant to be together?

That type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other

I really think you and your coach need each other

Or maybe you just need to play a lil' better

I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time

Before you hurt your team, I think that you'll be doin' just fine

If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Russ

Why you trying to fuss? Try to understand, that I do consider you my Cuz

I just don't want you to do some crazy shit

I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick

Some dude got traded and ran his team into the ground

And had a new coach on the team, and he just kept getting clowned

And that team that made the trade, they extended the guy too

Come to think about, his name was, it was you

Damn!","Russ (inspired by ""Stan"" by Eminem)"
nfl,,Broncos lose to Chargers 19-16. This Jeudy drop would’ve won the game.
nfl,"I genuinely dont understand the hype. The guy was brought in as a defensive coach, hailed a ""defensive genius"", to a roster with some holes but overrall a ton of talent and playmakers on D. Last year they finished with the 31st ranked defense overall and the worst team against the run, and missed thr playoffs to the raiders in a weak division.

This offseason they go out and get Mack, JC Jackson, and Sebastian Jospeh-Day as well as others, lose no major parts, and effectively get crowned as AFC favourites. Despite his performance last year, Brandon Staley is crowned Coach of the Year favourite by Vegas betting odds.

Of course as weve all seen this year, [it has been just as bad, if not worse.](https://i.imgur.com/jOYSit7.jpg). Yet despite this, people still think hes the saviour of the Chargers. Im not going to dive into how it was his call to hire Joe Lombardi who cant coordinate a family dinner let alone a functional nfl offense, just highlighting it as evidence of coaching malpractice basically on both sides of the ball.

Shortsman was good again, as he continues his early season tear, and the Bills move to 5-1 heading into the bye. It’s early in the season still, but this might end up being among the most important games of the year in regards to playoff seeding. The Bills now have first place in the AFC, along with tie breakers over the Chiefs, Ravens, and Titans. Headed into their bye week Buffalo is through what should be the hardest stretch of their schedule. There’s a lot of football left, and the Bills will need to continue rolling out of the bye against a struggling Packers team. Getting All-Pro cornerback Tre’Davious White back should help bring even more energy to this Bills defense. It’ll be important to hold onto the first seed, and avoid another trip to Arrowhead this January. Our hearts here in Buffalo couldn’t take it.
2.	| [](/PHI) | Eagles | 	--	|	6-0	|	The Eagles beat [some overrated team from Texas](https://i.redd.it/kc5pcrktceu91.jpg) on Sunday night to advance to 6-0, second best start in franchise history.  [Jalen Hurts](https://i.redd.it/hptpqc56oau91.jpg), [AJ Brown](https://i.redd.it/sklpiml7pgu91.jpg), [Chauncey Gardner-Johnson](https://i.redd.it/10xanp1snau91.jpg) and [Jason Kelce](https://v.redd.it/wfiptmni3fu91) put on a masterful performance heading into the bye week.  With the NFL's easiest remaining schedule looming, the Eagles look to sure up some inconsistencies against the run and in special teams coverage while simultaneously eyeing the #1 seed in the NFC.
3.	| [](/KC) | Chiefs | 	--	|	4-2	|	A tough, but not too tough, loss for the Chiefs. The Bills were able to do just enough against the Chiefs young and depleted defense to power past the Chiefs at home. The issue in this game was actually the offense, who had multiple opportunities to put the game away in the 4th quarter and did not come through. Of the issues on offense the tackles and their poor play is the deficiency that seems the most dire. Orlando Brown Jr and Andrew Wylie are just not good enough and in a league full of great edge rushers that might be an issue going forward.
4.	| [](/MIN) | Vikings | 	+3	|	5-1	|	The Vikings went three-and-out on ten of their fifteen total drives on Sunday and yet still wound up with a relatively comfortable win over the Dolphins, thanks to Za'Darius Smith (11 pressures, 2 sacks), Patrick Peterson (3 PBUs, one INT) and, of course, Justin Jefferson (who accounted for 42% of the team's total yards). The Vikings head into the bye 5-1 yet somehow just 13th in offensive EPA/play, 13th in defensive EPA/play and 17th in DVOA. But in the land of parity, the team with four one-score wins (and every starter healthy!) is king.
5.	| [](/NYG) | Giants | 	+6	|	5-1	|	When Joe Schoen and Brian Daboll inherited the mess of a roster that was the New York Giants, it was clear there was a lot of work to do. Any rationally thinking fan thought this would be a multi-year rebuild, and that 2022 was more or less a throwaway year while Schoen and co. righted the wrongs that the previous regime committed to make NY's roster so barren in the first place. I'm not sure anybody could have expected what 2022 has turned into for the G-Men. Daboll, Martindale and Kafka have these players completely bought in, and rallying around the coaching staff and themselves to play some of the best football of their careers. From Saquon and Andrew Thomas, to the defense as a whole, to even Danny Dimes having a career year. Take a look at the Giants depth chart and then their W-L total if you think Brian Daboll should be anything short of the clear frontrunner for Coach of the Year at this point in time. We'll see if Big Blue continues to play hard as they take on a Jaguars team looking for a win after three straight L's.
6.	| [](/DAL) | Cowboys | 	-1	|	4-2	|	It was a wild ride, but all good things must come to an end. Cooper Rush lost a start, and the defense allowed a second touchdown. However, the defense was put in some bad spots by offensive decisions (three scoring drives starting on the wrong side of the 50) and a couple questionable calls by the officials. The Eagles were held to 3.9 yards per play, nearly a full yard below the averages of the worst offenses in the league and less than 70% of their season average. Special teams did their job well, and the coaching made necessary adjustments at half time. This loss makes winning the division look much harder, but all that gets you is a tee shirt. With Dak returning and the rest of the team clicking, this is a team that will make people sweat in January.
7.	| [](/LAC) | Chargers | 	+3	|	4-2	|	To quote the words of the Babadook, ""Why can't you just be normal?!"" For the third week in a row the Chargers turn it into a butt-clencher and for the 2nd week in a row a FG to end the game literally caused my wife to pee her pants (hey, don't judge!). After falling behind early again, the Chargers' defense finally steps up, ironically by benching their prized offseason acquisition JC Jackson. And for once the Chargers are on the other side of special teams choking the game away. The offense struggled mightily and if the return of Keenan Allen and Corey Linsley next week doesn't help the offense get back on track then this could be an ugly season.
8.	| [](/BAL) | Ravens | 	-3	|	3-3	|	Ravens went 3-3 in a surprisingly tough slate of games, trailing for only 10% of the season, due to exercising the second amendment on their foot. Lamar playing unnecessary hero ball with the lead and targeting the fullback was one of many things which lost the game. This offense is really missing Bateman and this defense is really missing Williams. Team is as close to 6-0 as they are to 2-4 at the present, but on the bright side, we are leading the AFC North, so that's something.
9.	| [](/TB) | Buccaneers | 	-3	|	3-3	|	Something's wrong in Tampa Bay. The defense is asleep at the wheel with games on the line. The play-calling from Byron Leftwich remains stagnant, lacking innovation, and relying heavily on a run game that is on track for the worst EPA by play since 1999. And most importantly, a young interior line of Luke Goedeke (LG) and Robert Hainsey (C) appear incapable of keeping a clean pocket for Brady. Against the Steelers, the Bucs OL allowed 2 sacks, 3 hits, and 3 hurries. From the looks of Brady, he doesn't appear to be having fun with mediocrity and was seen chewing out his OL with his spit flying into orbit in a way that would make Bill Cowher proud. Worse-- Cameron Brate went off the field in a stretcher in yet another severe concussion. The Steelers were supposed to be an easy W to get the Bucs back on track, but now, looking at the Panthers, Ravens, Rams, and Seahawks in the next four weeks, the Bucs are in for a world of hurt until they begin to find their non-existent identity. Put on a face shield, because Tom Brady is going to be screaming a lot in the next couple of weeks. 
10.	| [](/CIN) | Bengals | 	+3	|	3-3	|	Just when things were looking down on Sunday, the Bengals offense found a way to break through late against the Saints. Right around the same time, the Giants nabbed a huge comeback over the Ravens and all of a sudden the Bengals find themselves tied for the division lead again. Joe Burrow has quietly been great since his week one collapse vs the Steelers. Reminding everyone that he missed all of camp due to an appendectomy and likely just needed a few weeks to get his groove back. 
11.	| [](/NYJ) | Jets | 	+8	|	4-2	|	It’s starting to feel like the Jets are for real. Winners of 3 in a row, Jets handed the Packers their first loss in Lambeau since November 1st, 2020. The star of the game was Quinnen Williams, who is finally playing like the all-pro defensive tackle the Jets thought they were getting when they drafted him 3rd overall in 2019. Quinnen recorded 6 pressures, 2 sacks, 2 TFLs, 3 QB hits, a forced fumble, and a blocked FG. Next week, the Jets put their 3-0 record on the road to the test in Denver.
12.	| [](/SF) | 49ers | 	-4	|	3-3	|	The Falcons flipped the game plans on the 49ers in week 6, coming in with a strong run game and defensive schemes that stopped the run.  Coming in as the #1 run game in the league, the run game ground to a halt to the tune of 50 total rushing yards.  With the ground game fruitless, the air attack got it close before halftime, but was unsuccessful in scoring in the second half.  The vaunted but injured defense was run over by the Falcons rushing attack, surrendering 168 rushing yards and allowing them to control the game.  Next week sees a possible return of multiple key figures, including Bosa and Williams, against the Chiefs coming of a loss of their own.
13.	| [](/GB) | Packers | 	-4	|	3-3	|	If I had a nickel for every time the Packers had an inexcusable loss against a New York team this October because the team completely collapsed in the second half I'd have two nickels, which isn't a lot but pretty infuriating that it happened twice in a row
14.	| [](/LAR) | Rams | 	--	|	3-3	|	Despite another O-line injury and Stafford pick six, the Rams bounced back and handled the Panthers. The (only) strength of the team is the defense who are only allowing 13ppg in their last 5 games, which makes the offensive struggles all the more unfortunate. With A-Rob showing signs of life and the Rams [getting some key guys back after the bye](https://twitter.com/jourdanrodrigue/status/1582123318886354953?s=46&amp;t=dwZTcNd5VfT8woG9aUGmag) perhaps the ship can get turned around. See you in week 8.
15.	| [](/TEN) | Titans | 	--	|	3-2	|	In a slow bye week the Titans managed to [reply all to NFL refs](https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/10/16/tennessee-titans-mike-vrabel-nfl-officiating-reply-all-email), see the [retirement of Delanie Walker](https://twitter.com/Titans/status/1582365938980110336?s=20&amp;t=B5tNynh0WD5uO6EmNTrRpg)
16.	| [](/NE) | Patriots | 	--	|	3-3	|	::SOAP BOX:: Deshaun Watson is a serial sexual predator. The Browns committed to him knowing that he is a serial sexual predator. Nothing the Browns do on a football field deserves attention or comment, because their brand is not football. Their brand is a serial sexual predator. ::OFF SOAP BOX:: I feel bad for the Dolphins. It must suck not to have an innovator like Matt Patricia who can scheme up an offense that even a third string QB can execute. Maybe I’m giving Patricia too much credit, though. It might be Joe Judge that is doing such a good job getting Bailey Zappe ready to play. It’s hard to say exactly. It’s a good thing the ‘Phins head coach is so funny and charming, though. Otherwise people might notice they’re on a 3 game losing streak. Meanwhile the “talentless”, “inept”, “boring to watch” Pats host the Bears next week aiming to climb above .500 with just 10 games left in the season. Good thing they didn’t panic fire the whole coaching staff in August. It’s a process, ya’ll.
17.	| [](/MIA) | Dolphins | 	-5	|	3-3	|	For the third week in a row, our starting quarterback didn’t make it to the end of the first half and a backup played the majority of the half. Despite starting a rookie 7th round QB, said rookie getting injured, then his backup taking over, we had a great chance to win against the 5-1 Vikings near the end of the game. A costly fumble with a few minutes to go helped turn a 10-17 deficit into an eventual 10-24 hole we couldn’t get out of. Despite falling to 3-3 after a 3-0 start, there is light at the end of tunnel. Tua will finally be returning just in time for a huge primetime matchup against the Steelers. It’ll be interesting because not only will there be drama stemming from the concussion controversy, but the Flores vs Tua storyline will be at the forefront as well.
18.	| [](/ATL) | Falcons | 	+5	|	3-3	|	The Falcons found themselves up by 14 in the third quarter, needing to hold a lead for over a quarter. ""We've all seen this before"" is what a rational fan should think, ""time for prevent"". Thankfully it didn't come to that, the niners had a 16 yard, 8 minute drive that took up most of the 4th quarter. The perfect drive for up 25, not down 14. Also - it's easier to close out games when QBs aren't losing fumbles, but Mariota went above and beyond by throwing only one incompletion.
19.	| [](/IND) | Colts | 	+7	|	3-2-1	|	Fifty-eight pass attempts and *zero* sacks. How the fuck did that happen? The answer might be simpler than you think: the Colts are the best team in NFL history. In all seriousness, it seems that they've finally found a stable offensive line combination. Matt Ryan stunted on many hoes as he threw for three touchdowns and almost four hundred yards. Who knew that your quarterback will play better when you give him time in the pocket? The offense as a whole was impressive. Each skill player contributed in some significant form. Michael Pittman Jr. racked up over a hundred-thirty yards, Kylen Granson converted some clutch third downs, Parris Campbell caught a tuddie, and rookie Alec Pierce iced the game with a spectacular 32-yard touchdown grab. That's not even mentioning Deon Jackson and Jelani Woods, who had a TD each. For the first time this season, the team actually played consistently well. There's a lot to be optimistic about here.
20.	| [](/SEA) | Seahawks | 	+5	|	3-3	|	The Seahawks took down the Cardinals in a classic Seattle/Arizona ugly game. Surprisingly, it was the defense stepping up and bending, but not breaking, that boosted Seattle to the win. For the second week straight, rookie Coby Bryant forced a fumble (this time coming from QB Kyler Murray) that rookie Tariq Woolen recovered. And for the fourth straight week, Tariq Woolen intercepted a pass, bringing his season (and Seahawks team total) to 4 interceptions on the year. The Seahawks draft class has shown out early and often this season. The offense, while semi quiet, did well enough and got the job done. Geno played a fine game, throwing no touchdowns but doing what the team needed him to do. Rookie running back Ken Walker III had a great day running the ball, accounting for 97 yards on 21 carries with a touchdown. This has been an exciting team this season and watching the rookies blossom has been a dream.
21.	| [](/ARI) | Cardinals | 	-4	|	2-4	|	Remember last week when I said “the negativity in the fanbase feels a little unwarranted at *this* point”? I lied. I lied to all of you. And you let me. Right to your faces. Shame on you, and shame on me for even THINKING things were remotely ok. They’re not. They’re not ok. Not even close. What is the opposite of ok? Because whatever that may be, it’s the Cardinals offense. Is Keim the problem? Yes, absolutely! Is Kliff the problem? Becoming more and more indisputable every day. Is Kyler the problem? At certain times, yeah. Am I the problem? Starting to feel like it for still believing in anything regarding this franchise. When does basketball season start so I can have my hopes and dreams smashed into pieces by the color purple rather than the color red?
22.	| [](/NO) | Saints | 	-1	|	2-4	|	Of all the weeks to go toe-to-toe with the Bengals, it would take an ardent Saints fan to not be surprised at the final score in this game with the Saints down three receivers and forced to field the 'breakout candidates' of 2020. You could sense the Red Rifle's desire to best his old team, but rather than playing up, it showed the weaknesses in his game as he had an inefficient output (which you can also lay at the feet of those receivers). Joe Burrow meanwhile kept the scoreboard ticking over, staying in striking distance, with Ja'Marr Chase working his magic. The end result was a loss, but one the team probably feels better about than the three which came before it.
23.	| [](/CLE) | Browns | 	-5	|	2-4	|	Football bad. Not good. No good football played. Browns not good. Also not good right now league wide. Fans sad. Browns frown. The Browns will face the division rival Ravens in Baltimore for, probably, more bad football next week.
24.	| [](/JAX) | Jaguars | 	-4	|	2-4	|	Why are you reading this section? I know the Jaguars are trash, you know the Jaguars are trash, the Jaguars know the Jaguars are trash. Perhaps one day they will not be trash, but that day is not today. Outlook not so good.
25.	| [](/OAK) | Raiders | 	-3	|	1-4	|	Coming off our bye, we look to salvage what was an absolutely awful start to our season. The Raiders are the better team in their next 6 matchups, if this team wants to make a playoff push it starts against the Texans this week.
26.	| [](/PIT) | Steelers | 	+3	|	2-4-0	|	Sunday's game was elegantly simple and easy to understand: Pittsburgh came to play. People caught catchable balls, and despite injuries, all hands were on deck and ready to play. The game was not only close in points scored, but also the box score. TOP, yards - all of it. What stands out from those stats this time is that the Steelers ran the ball 29 times and passed it 30. It seems that with balance and energy, this team can win.
27.	| [](/DEN) | Broncos | 	-3	|	2-4	|	Hypothesis: The Broncos are a football team. While I haven't discovered any evidence of this personally, I've been assured that they may exist, or have existed, and played the sport. A premier contributor in the cryptozoology field who specializes in the study of extinct beings has shared with me a blurry photograph of what appears to be Russell Wilson scoring a touchdown - he believes this may still occur rarely today, though I'm skeptical there's any truth to that. In search of the mythical football team ""The Broncos,"" I have eschewed the methods of conventional science in order to produce any shred of proof of their existence. Firsthand accounts tell of their mating cry, ""Broncos Country, Let's Ride!"" describing it as a joyful outburst that may both precede a football game or follow after a 'successful play.' An advertisement portraying an artist's best recreation of what 'DangeRuss Wilson' might look like has circulated on social media. While broad cryptozoological consensus maintains that The Broncos native habitat is the greater Denver, CO area, and that they may in fact have even visited the stadium that primarily hosts the city's decorated lacrosse team, the only archeological signs I've found so far match more closely to a 'dove field' than a practice facility they may have once used. What's more promising, the International Society of Cryptozoology has hypothesized that The Broncos may soon appear in London, England. Again, healthy skepticism is recommended given the distance from their generally agreed upon habitat; I do not recommend anyone arrive in London with high expectations of experiencing a sighting of The Broncos. This cryptid is most likely extinct, if it ever existed at all. One sarcastic interviewee I exchanged emails with posited that The Broncos went extinct because they couldn't Hackett. This spelling error could just as likely be a clue to their demise as it could be a half-hearted joke from a skeptic who gave up on ever proving the existence of this cryptozoological marvel. I will continue my search in London, and look forward to sharing my cautious optimism for a sighting with anyone else who decides the effort is worth their time.

28.	| [](/DET) | Lions | 	-1	|	1-4	|	This bye week on /r/detroitlions, predictably, has been all about how much the team fucked up by hiring Dan Campbell and by taking the picks the team has gotten over the last few years. However, I wanted to give kudos to the attention and research one user, /u/FunetikPrugresiv, put forth toward [their writeup](https://old.reddit.com/r/detroitlions/comments/y1a6yd/so_about_that_pff_grade_hutchinson_played_a_very/) on why Hutchinson seemed to be a non-factor against New England. TLDR version: Belichick and his team structured the offensive game plan for the Pats in such a way as to never be in danger from Hutch. **Bye Health**: The Lions come out of the bye week with hopefully most of their major pieces back in place. Jamo is likely not going to play until sometime around Weeks 10-12, but anything is possible, and he's hungry to get out on the field. Walker and Onwuzurike are gone for the year, and a couple of other players are out for an extended time to come. However, most of the O-line should be back, and Hutchinson should be getting help with the potential return of Cominsky, Paschal, and *maybe* R. Okwara over the next couple of weeks. In addition, the week off should be good news for both St. Brown and Swift, two major weapons in Detroit's early-season offensive success. **Up Next**: A Dallas team that was just embarrassed in the 1st half by Philly, yet managed to make a game of it late. Following that comes Miami with a pissed-off Tua likely back to full action, then Green Bay and Chicago. If the coaches didn't make the right adjustments during this week off, the team very well could be sitting at 1-8 or 2-7 by the end of that stretch. Personally, I think the team is better than that, and just some slight improvements in the defense (as in, force some bloody punts, damn it!) and hopefully not losing eight players a game due to injury will pay off in some extra Ws.
29.	| [](/CHI) | Bears | 	-1	|	2-4	|	“I'm tired of being just this close,” said Justin Fields after the game, succinctly summarizing the Bears’ worse loss of the (young!) season. The Bears played like absolute, steaming, Bears-fans-should-pay-reparations-for-generational-trauma crap in this game. But at the same time they also outgained Washington 2-to-1 and had 3 possessions inside the 5 (that led to a stunning 3 total points). It’s hard to tell if the Bears’ offense is progressing or if it will always be this close forever and ever. But joke’s on you, America, the Bears are back in primetime next week!
30.	| [](/WAS) | Commanders |	+2	|	2-4	|	Well, Washington managed to win an ugly 12-7 TNF race to the bottom against Chicago but it still somehow felt more deflating than a loss would have. I think we all know Ron Rivera is about to lead this team to just enough wins to avoid a top draft pick but not enough to be competitive. At least Dan Snyder was called out on primetime for being the petty little loser and shit-stain rat-fuck he is. Oh, Wentz hurt his finger and is out 4-6 weeks but it kinda doesn’t matter with the offensive output we’ve seen the last 4 weeks. It’s gotta either be the same or better with Heinicke, right? Right…?
31.	| [](/HOU) | Texans | 	-1	|	1-3-1	|	Despite not playing this week, the Texans clearly won the bye week. Our own personal Grima Wormtongue, Jack ""What is he doing on the sidelines?"" Easterby officially got the boot and it feels like a giant leap in the right direction. The weird sorta-chaplain turned executive is finally gone, and now football decisions are back under the purview of (ostensibly) professional football people. It does remove the last excuse for Caserio and Co however, so any boneheaded decisions will be on the GM, the head coach and his staff from now on. But the sun is just a little brighter today, because Easterby no longer darkens the doorways on Kirby. 
32.	| [](/CAR) | Panthers | 	--	|	1-5	|	This season is misery. Even without Matt Rhule, the offense looked inept. PJ Walker, our 3rd starting QB this year, had only *1 Air Yard* on all 10 of his completed passes *combined*. Then he got hurt and we trotted on Jacob Eason, who sounds like some dude cooked up in a Bill Belichick lab to catch every clutch 3rd and 1 pass in history. This all happened after a report came out about how Matt Rhule walked around with a document titled “The Way of the Panther” and made staff members recite it upon command.

nfl,"Hello Reddit, today I come to you with deep knowledge and well researched facts in an attempt to prove to you all that Kyle Shanahan, boy-genius of the NFL and well known offensive mastermind is afraid of birds.

As many know, Kyle Shanahan's overall record as a Head Coach in the NFL over 6-ish years and 87 regular season games is 42-45, a .483 winning percentage. This is not very good on it's face, and you may wonder how such a coach could keep their job. After all, Matt Nagy was fired with a career win percent of .523. However, there is one factor that almost no one has picked up on, and that is the wild disparity between Kyle Shanahan's record in games vs. Bird Teams and games vs. the rest of the NFL.

#The Data

Kyle Shanahan is 8-20 in games vs Bird Teams, good for a 0.286 winning percentage. The breakdown among the Bird Teams is as such:

* Seattle Seahawks: 3-8

* Arizona Cardinals: 3-7

* Atlanta Falcons: 1-2

* Philadelpha Eagles: 1-2

* Baltimore Ravens: 0-1

If you remove his bird team games from his coaching record we has a record of 34-25, a .576 win percentage, which is far more respectable. The 49ers point differential in games vs Bird Teams is -101, while in all other games it is +206. The 49ers score 26.2 PPG against all other NFL teams and only 19.8 PPG against Bird Teams, almost a whole touchdown less. This is while allowing a similar amount against, 22.6 PPG allowed against all other NFL teams and 23.4 PPG allowed against Bird Teams. This suggests that the issue lies with Shanahan, who controls the offense and plays hands off with the defense.

&amp;nbsp;

*^all ^data ^was ^sourced ^from ^[PFR](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/)*

#But wait... this can't be fair he has two bird teams in his Division!

Some might choose to make this argument. They, of course, miss the fact that while it is true that Shahahan has two bird teams in division, meaning he will face them more often (this is especially relevant for the years the 49ers were terrible), he also has complete ownage over the only non-bird team in the division. Against the Los Angeles Rams the 49ers under Shahanan are 8-3, with a current regular season win streak of 7.

This objection is further compounded when faced with the fact that in the 2019 SuperBowl Loss season, the 49ers under Shanahan went 13-3. Their only losses that regular season came to the **Seahawks, Ravens, and Falcons**, three bird teams. Even when having the one of the best teams in the league, Shanahan will lose to birds, because he fears them intrinsically.

# Why is Kyle Shanahan afraid of birds?

Who knows, could be he was chased by crows as a child. Or it could be he is eternally scarred by being Offensive Coordinator for the Falcons the year they blew a 28-3 lead in the Superbowl.

#Why did you spend the time to write this?

idk lol

#In Conclusion

Kyle Shanahan clearly has some deep-seated fears of birds he needs to work out with lots of therapy before his San Francisco 49ers will be able to truly dominate the NFL.

nfl,"邱家军迷恋与黑人肛交不能自拔  自废自弃恐成民运掘墓人

本人2001年同父母一起入籍美国，当年整29岁，如今却已进入知命之年。回想那些日子，血气方刚，结交了不少好友，认识的人可以说五花八门，形色各异。

王丹是我来美后认识的第一个民运好友，后来就是维参，也就是大家口中的韦石，只是二十多年，叫维参都习惯了，我们都是无话不说的好友，民运事业也算蒸蒸日上。直到2018年，一个叫邱家军的人逃到美国来，民运便开始乱套了。实话说，什么人没见过，但像邱家军这类人，实属第一次。2018年初，第一次见到邱家军，他本人不像我所想象的那么文质彬彬，相反全身上下散发一股痞气。他虽一直在点头哈腰，但不知为何却总有“这人想谋朝纂位”这种感觉，让人感到不适，这就是我对他的第一印象。加之后来听说的种种，更是让人对他嗤之以鼻。

王丹性取向几乎是人人皆知的，但我从未因为这个问题对他产生过不满，但自从王丹告诉我，邱家军与他是一类人的时候，胸口突然涌来一股热潮，当时差点没憋住，好在我立刻转移话题，开始跟他讨论起下一次会议内容。这是第二次对他的印象。

第三次对他的印象，就是通过维参了。他告诉我听到一些流言，邱家军与黑人搞肛交，有一次甚至在邱家军办公室被抓包。在我印象中，与维参一直是议事议政不议人，这次却例外。虽说是流言，但我一直认为流言也有出处，若他真没有做，自然不会有人去诽谤他。从那以后，从别人口中得知的这类消息越来越多了，比如得了艾滋病、肛交等等，就在今年，还有人一度怀疑他消失的那段时间是不是得了猴痘！

后来的一次见面，是在2019年12月，因王怡牧师的事，他摇身一变成了发言人，呼吁中共释放几名牧师及博士。他说得义正严词，我却听得心惊胆战。我注意到周围人似乎也在有意无意的远离他。当然，这些停留在流言阶段的东西也不能彻底阻断交往，毕竟大家都在同一圈子。直到今年8月26，那一天看到的一幕将我震惊了！导致现在还历历在目。那天我像往日一样到时代广场发传单，一直到夜里9点左右，因为孩子到好友家住宿，妻子也不在家，闲着无聊于是返回家里查看邮件，刚一坐下就弹出一封最邮件，是一个做民运事业的好友发送的。里面附有一段视频，看样子是偷拍的画面，邱家军赤裸着身体，和两个黑人男子在同时在肛交，那画面到现在想起还有些反胃。

人有七情六欲，但作为民运人士，行为多少要有点约束，若民运人人如此，还有何未来可言？希望邱家军若看到此文可以痛改前非，至少稍微检点一些，不要让他人看我们民运笑话！",邱家军迷恋与黑人肛交不能自拔 自废自弃恐成民运掘墓人

 Please see below for the ranking explanation:

This ranking assumes that there are never any fluke games and all teams are appropriately ranked. If you beat a team that is higher ranked than you, you move ahead of them and they move down one spot. However, other teams can jump in front of teams that are higher ranked than you, moving you further down the rankings.

The rankings were derived from the 2020 season opening NFL Title Belt holder as the only team ranked (Chiefs). The first team to beat them (Raiders-week 5) took first place and moved the Chiefs to second. In week 7, the Bucs beat the Raiders, moving both teams down.

With the Lions' first win of the 2021 season, all teams have beaten a team who has beaten a team who has beaten a team... who beat the Title Belt holding 2020 Chiefs in week 5. Please note that tracking the rankings back further back than 2020 will not make a difference because all rankings are eventually set by losses by the belt holders. Any team that is ranked higher than the Browns this year must have either beaten them or beaten a team that had already jumped them (has a path of beating teams that leads to the Browns). Bye weeks and ties do not affect a team's relative rankings. However, they can still shift down due to lower ranked teams jumping higher ranked teams.","NFL Title Rankings Week 6, 2022 Season"

nfl,"Obviously i say this jokingly but man. Since 2000 the players are only better, the professional athlete has progressed a ton. But coaching, has it declined or has it always been this bad? I'm 30 and been watching avidly since I was 8 so I've seen my fair share of ball, but this is something else. 

Last week w the Raiders just doing everything they could to blow that game, McDaniels looked over his head again. 

Then tonight, speaks for itself. That last 3rd and 7 for the Broncos, was laughable. They couldn't get 5 yards through the air consistently, and draw up a double move to try and get 30, on a play where Russ never even looked at a second read. Not to mention the drive before 3 and 1, running the ball well and yes let's drop back. 

I'll answer my own question, the coaching has gotten worse and there's some people in this subreddit that could call an NFL offense better than what were seeing some nights. What I'm saying is your dream might not be dead, get out there and apply yourself because I need better football to watch.

nfl,"Defenses have been getting more and more athletic over the last decade and especially the last 5 years.

They just needed the scheme to make it work. Cover 2 is not new, but it had fallen out of favor. 

Now that it's back, and matched with such athletic linebackers, lineman and DB's, it's really hard for offenses to consistently move the chains. 

&amp;#x200B;

Offenses have not lost their minds, even Mahomes/Allen only combined for 44 points, defenses have just gotten really athletic, and found the scheme to match that athleticism. 

&amp;#x200B;

Note, this is really thanks to Todd Bowles covering Hill 1 on 1, and getting torched for 200 yards in a single quarter.

Because of that, we got to see the A/B test in the second half of that game of them playing Cover 2. And it woke every DC up, the Super Bowl just continued this, and now we have the present day situation.","Can we stop pretending offenses have just magically lost their minds? This is all thanks to the last decade of defenses getting lighter / faster, matched with every DC seeing Cover 2 stop the most electric offense (Hill/Kelce/Mahomes) of the last decade and copying it."

Fast forward to now and it seems like half the league will be looking to either draft a QB this year or find some other way to shake things up. 

Granted, it doesn’t help that several veterans seem to be falling off of a cliff this year, combined with the fact that most of the “experiments” this year seem to have failed, while last year a lot paid off. 

Last year, there seemed to be only 5 teams that could be categorized as “uncomfortable” with their QB situation and without a plan
Broncos, Panthers, Saints, Commies, and Steelers

Every other team either had a quality starter, someone they were comfortable with, or a new experiment to try out 

Looking at this season, you can see way more just by looking at the obvious ones. While this list for last year was looking back in hindsight, and this season is still early. Which really drives home the fact of how much bigger this list is and how much things have changed 

Seahawks (Geno is for real?), Commies, Falcons (unless Riddler starts and gives them hope), Colts, Panthers (x2), Saints, Bucs (Brady probably retires FOR REALZIES this time)

This isn’t even counting a lot of QBs that seemed like surefire bets at the start of the season have some kind of storyline creating uncertainty for them and the team

The Kyler drama

The “Dak vs Wentz” debate shifting from who is the better top QB to who is the most injury prone mid off

Russel Wilson sucking all of the sudden

Tom Brady going from imagining Gisele’s face on his opponents to his teammates (and tablets)

Is Stafford hurt or just falling off/how much of each is it?

Rodgers and the Packers falling apart

The Browns/Watson uncertainty

Mac not taking the jump everyone expected (forgiving Mac though, only had a few weeks of sample size and his WRs really suck)

Not even gonna try to break down the Giants, everyone sucks yet they are 5-1

PLUS a bunch of QBs that may be beginning to overstay their welcome such as Tanny, Kirk (obviously not if they keep this record up), Carr (maybe if the season collapses)

What do you guys think? Are we just looking in the moment? How will the outlook of this list change at the end of the year? This year is looking like there may be a MASSIVE QB shakeup",How did the NFL go from a time of QB prosperity to what seems like QB hell so quickly?

nfl,"I can't find too much about the real nitty gritty of some of these deals. I get the basics of signing bonuses and dead money, June 1st this and that, but I have a few more questions.

**How does non-signing bonus guaranteed money work?**

I know about being guaranteed for injury/performance/cap but how does it come into play? Is it paid out just like normal salary? Does getting cut mean this is treated like a signing bonus and accelerated or does it count against caps in successive years? (a la Drew Brees and the Phantom years)

**How do performance incentives count for cut players?**

Would ""Likely to be earned"" incentives be counted to the cap and paid out, or is it all lost? What year(s) does it hit the cap if at all?

**How much leeway do teams have for eating chunks of traded players contracts?**

If your player has a rough contract, what are your options to make it more palatable for a trade partner? Are you limited to just converting Salary into Signing bonus?

**Does signing bonus have to be spread evenly?**

He-who-must-not-be-named (except in civil suits) is only getting $1M this season with $244M over the next 4. Does that mean his signing bonus was only $5M or was there some malarkey in there?

nfl,"As someone who likes to follow the NFL but often can't watch the games live. I love to watch the game highlights on YouTube the morning after. The frustrating part is that the thumbnail for the videos often reveals which team won the game, by having a picture of a player from the winning team during a play.
Is this something that has been discussed before?

nfl,"First off, I do know that a tie is counted as half a win, half a loss.  But I start getting confused once bye weeks come into play.

Take the current standings.  We've got the Chargers (at least until tonight) and the Titans at 3-2, the Colts at 3-2-1, and too many teams to bother listing here at 3-3.  3-2-1 (or 3.5-2.5) is placed inbetween 3-2 and 3-3, which doesn't entirely make sense to me.  The ""2.5 losses"" part makes sense going between 2 losses and 3 losses, but then the ""3.5 wins"" part should put the Colts ahead of the Chargers and Titans as well, since they only have 3 wins.

Is there something here I'm missing?",How are tied factored into a team's standings?

nfl,Why dont nfl teams throw the running back over the defense or give him some kind of jump Assistence. Maybe even just a big guy acting like some sort of launching pad.

nfl,"So why? I think quarterbacks should only get credit for the yards they actually throw the ball. There are so many mediocre quarterbacks with great wide receivers who throw the ball 3 yards and then thanks to the athletic ability of their receivers, get credit for the 60 yards their receiver earned through YAC. Some will argue that it is the quarterback’s placement of the ball that allows their YAC. And I would agree. However this isn’t always the case. I thinks QB’s should get credit for yards in the air and receivers only yards they gain after the catch. So if a receiver catches the ball that was thrown 20 yards and tackled immediately, they would get credit for a catch but no yards. Let it rip….",Why should quarterbacks get credit for YAC?

This could just be Romo being Romo and saying whatever he wants, or maybe was sarcasm, but if someone from upstairs or NY did tell them to switch the call;

1. Why cant the do this on other clear cut missed calls? And I am not even saying judgement type calls like PI, only things that are black and white, Facemask, offsides, etc. As a Packer fan I can think of Zappe throwing that TD pass 3 seconds after the play clock ran out. That would take all of 10 seconds for someone upstairs or in NY to correct.

2. If they aren’t supposed to do that did the reffing team in NY just save the Chiefs a challenge, which could be a big deal in the end of this game?
