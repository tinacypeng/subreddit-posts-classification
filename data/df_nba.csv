nba,"Ok, title is pretty self explanatory. Let’s go

1. Clippers vs Suns

It’s not a perfect version of this matchup, but these teams haven’t liked each other. I expect a physical game. 

2. Jazz vs Pelicans

Pels being good was the go to “hot” take this off season and they’ve lived up. Utah are the 96 bulls so far. 

3. Cavs vs wizards 

I dunno man this game looks good. I know that the wizards have had hot starts before and the Cavs are new and shiny. I think it will be a good game. Third best in fact. 


4. Trailblazers vs Lakers 

The blazers are undefeated and the lakers are winless, so we may see a hard played game to get that first w. 


5.   Kings vs Warriors

Ok, this is my wildcard pick that could be higher. No good reason the warriors shouldn’t dominate, with the kings coming off a tough loss BUT I think the game might still be good.


6. Timberwolves vs thunder

The thunder games have been pretty entertaining so far but I don’t think you can rank them too high.

7. Hornets vs hawks

nba,"I'm of course aware that if you get fouled and the shot misses, it doesn't count as a field goal attempt. But if we did count such cases as shot attempts, then Giannis went 7 of 8 last night on these opportunities. ([source](https://www.nba.com/game/hou-vs-mil-0022200033/play-by-play?period=Q1))

This is absolute insanity. For reference, Giannis led the league in And-1s (made baskets while being fouled) last season with 86, or 1.3 per game. So to get 7 in a single game is Monstar-level production. 

Furthermore, to convert 87.5% of these opportunities is also highly abnormal. For context, among all high-volume foul-drawers last season (at least 200 shooting fouls drawn), KAT had the highest shooting percentage on these opportunities at 31.5% ([source](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_play-by-play.html)).",Giannis shot 7/8 (87.5%) on shot attempts in which he was fouled last night vs. Houston
nba,"So I didn't come up with this rule change, but I did copy it from [baseball](https://np.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/dqbbon/one_new_rule_to_fix_three_true_outcomes_poor/) and adapted it to fix the NBA's tanking problem.

Here's the basic idea: instead of fining or relegating a tanking team, when a top 5 pick is made by a team that tanked the previous year, there is a chance that Adam Silver will shoot the player on-stage instead of giving them a handshake.

The actual percentage change would be based on the severity of the team's tanking.  Due to the amount of advanced stats available these days, it may be possible to scientifically determine how many wins a team has sat and/or traded away via win shares to define the chance for each specific team.

For example, let's take the Rockets after trading away James Harden.  As a refresher, The Rockets traded Harden to the Nets for Caris LeVert, Rodions Kurucs, and future picks.

That season, Harden played only 8 games in Houston and accrued 1 win share.  The previous year, he accrued 13.1 win shares.  This means they gave away 12.1 ""expected win shares"" (or ~9 in the worst case if you extrapolate the 1 win share to 82 games).

Meanwhile, LeVert and Kurucs only accrued 2.3 win shares the previous year, meaning the Rockets could expect 9/10 of that, or 2.1 win shares in 2020.

As such, we can determine that the Rockets tanked 9 or 10 wins in the 2020-2021 season via the Harden trade.

Now, the only question is how to translate these ""tanked wins"" to shooting chance.  As a real second amendment loving American and hater of people more talented than myself, I want as much shooting as possible and personally vote to have shooting chance equal (tanked wins) / (actual wins), meaning that on draft day, there would have been a 10/17, or 58% chance that Adam Silver would have shot Jalen Green.  Would the Rockets have tanked their team so much if their draft pick had a 3-in-5 chance of being shot?  I think not.  A less aggressive and less American option would be (tanked wins) / (actual wins + tanked wins), which would have given Green a 10/27 or 37% chance of being shot.

Obviously, there's a lot of wiggle room here.  The formula and chances would need to be adjusted for age-related improvements and declines, and the inherrent uncertainty will likely necessitate rounding as well as a cumulative probability based on multiple models.  But overall, I think the basic idea is sound.

So, to quickly round up the pros and cons of this approach.

Pros:

- The threat of having their draft pick shot should encourage teams to field more competitive rosters to minimize shooting risk

- Should be a more effective deterrent than fines, which imo would do nothing

- Wouldn't crater team value like relegation, so owners are more likely to implement it

- Regular-season viewership of bad teams should increase, as viewers would be invested in winning and preventing their next draft pick from getting shot

- Would likely increasing ratings for the draft

Cons:

- Most top draft picks bust anyways, so teams may accept the risk for the upside that the Zions and Wembanyanas of the draft offer

- This rule would heavily penalize teams that were good the previous year that decided to tank, not extended tanks like the Thunder or Process Sixers.

Overall, I think this rule has a lot of potential, but I'm extremely concerned about long-term tanking that might arise.  With some discussion and input from the league competition committee, I'm sure that a version of it could be used to dramatically reduce tanking.",One New Rule to Fix Tanking: (possibly) Shooting Top 5 Draft Picks

nba,[removed],Are You On The Christian Wood Train ?!
nba,,TYGA’S ALLEGED SEXTAPE WITH BELLA POARCH APPEARS ON THE INTERNET » NewsSupari
nba,"Watching the Celtics vs Magic game last night, I was really impressed with Orlando’s young core. There’s been a lot of buzz about them being on their way to becoming a perennial playoff team, and I can see it. 

The issue is, they say the same thing about Detroit, and I can see that too. If a team like Charlotte, Washington, or Indiana land Wembanyana, I can see people saying that about them too. Even Cleveland counts in this group since they technically didn’t make the main playoffs last year. 

So with all these teams looking like they’re on the precipice of becoming playoff teams, where are they gonna go? There’s only so many playoff spots available. They’d have to take the place of regular playoff teams, so who are the most likely candidates to go in the opposite direction? 

Based on last year’s top 8, here’s how I see their chances of letting one of these up-and-comers take their playoff spot:

**Miami Heat:** Their two leaders are 33 and 36 years old, so that inherently makes them seem like a good candidate. But they’re always going to be well coached and they’ve been well run pretty much since the moment Pat Riley got there. I could see them maintaining a really good team built around Herro and Bam. 

**Boston Celtics:** If our local sports radio has their way, this is a definite yes. They have been prophesying Brown and Tatum’s exit for like 2 1/2 years now, and if that happens then they’ll certainly fall out. But as long as they stay I can’t see them not being a playoff team. 

**Milwaukee Bucks:** Nope. Not a chance. If 34 is playing they’re never not going to win 50 games. And he’s still pretty young so I don’t see him going anywhere anytime soon.

**Philadelphia 76ers:** Now it gets interesting. Four years ago you would have said no way, now I’m not so sure. Harden isn’t getting any younger.  And this is the first year where the thought of Joel wanting out has even entered my mind. 

**Toronto Raptors:** They seem like a perpetual low ceiling, high floor team (relatively speaking.) They are well-coached and have a lot of good players. Unless Barnes takes a massive leap they might not have the top-end talent to win a title, but I could see them being a 2-5 seed for the next decade. 

**Chicago Bulls:** It might have already happened. 

**Brooklyn Nets:** The most obvious answer. Even moreso than the Bulls, who might not even be a playoff team this season. They really went for it and it almost worked out in 2021, but I don’t think they’re getting that close again with this core. 

**Atlanta Hawks:** They are an odd bunch. There isn’t a ton of winning infrastructure within that organization, and you need an absolute super-duper star to change the culture in those situations (like Lebron in Cleveland.) Is Trae that level? I’m not sure. That said, they are at least committed to building around him with players who complement his timeline, which says something. 


Ok, so that’s my analysts. If I had to rank the teams from most likely to fall off and make room for the young guys to least likely, it would go like this:

1.	Brooklyn
2.	Chicago
3.	Philadelphia
4.	Atlanta
5.	Miami
6.	Boston
7.	Toronto
8.	Milwaukee

Grant Williams then did an ultra-slow toss of the ball with backspin gently in the backcourt so the ball would roll ever so slowly.

Marcus Smart avoided touching the ball until the clock reached 3:07, and a referee inexplicably blew a whistle. The Celtics then had to inbound with a stopped clock at 3:07.

In my opinion, Boston did nothing wrong, and Marcus Smart should have avoided touching the ball to run as much clock as possible. If Orlando wants him to pick up the ball, go send a defender at the ball.

I was watching the Orlando feed, and the announcers never explained why the whistle was blown. Does anyone know why this happened?",Why did the referees stop play on a live-ball on Grant Williams inbounds roll to Marcus Smart with 3min left in Orlando?

nba,"INFORMATION:      
Back when Houston traded Harden at the start of the 2020-2021 season, they focused on a pick-centric return due to their obligations from the CP3-Westbrook trade, something that received a lot of criticism at the time.  (A Top-4 protected double swap in 2021, top-4 protected picks in 2024/2026, and a top-10 protected swap in 2025.)  Houston grabbed every unprotected swap and pick they could get from Brooklyn, and even leaned so hard into the idea that they converted Jarrett Allen into a Bucks pick that's conveying this year, unprotected. 

Fast forward after the Nets traded Harden to Brooklyn, they've ended up with the Sixers pick this year and a top-8 protected pick two years after the first to OKC for dumping Al Horford.
              
PREMISE:         
 If I'm the Nets, I might trade both Sixers picks to add lottery protections to whatever I still owe Houston. The KD trade demand showed the organization how perilous their position could quickly become and securing lottery protections on whatever still owed would lessen the potential fallout. For their part, instead of waiting around for a Nets pick to land high while potentially risking a pair of 5th overall picks in 3 years to OKC, the team could add a high-powered prospect to their growing list of young and exciting players.","If the Sixers are bad enough, could the Nets trade the pick to the Rockets for pick protections?"
nba,"Our perimeter defence is so bad, Ben gave us length and switch-ability that we are dearly missing. Our transition game is non existent and if we surround him with shooters (House, Maxey and Tucker) I feel like our half court offence will be decent.

They could make the announcement tomorrow and it would have a profound effect on the rest of the season. 

“Teams May draft in the Top 5 in any 2 consecutive years (except when the pick originated with a different team). 

They can still be in the lottery, but would shift to 6-10 if they got picks 1-5. 

So, just like that, the Magic, Thunder, Rockets, Kings, and Pistons would be incentivize to compete or else get a “second tier” lottery pick. By the way, 3 of those teams have already drafted top 5 two years in a row, so letting them have 3 in a row would be criminal.

The last time Philly beat Boston in the playoffs was in 1982, 40 years ago. My deceased grandmother was 37. This was Dr. J VS Larry Bird era.


With both Boston and Philly top 5 teams in the east this season, we could easily see another playoff searies between the 2.","Boston has won 5 Consecutive playoff series against Philadelphia, Philly hasn't won since 1982"

nba,"In NBA debates the argument for the greatest player of all time usually comes down to Michael Jordan and LeBron James, and the default third place pic is usually Kareem Abdul-Jabbar with some even saying he belongs in the conversation for greatest player of all time.


I believe that to be incorrect, he did not have the statistical dominance of Wilt Chamberlain he didn't have the dominant winning like Bill Russell, he doesn't have the overall combination of the two combined with peak like Michael Jordan, and what was his greatest asset which is longevity has already been surpassed by LeBron James considering how well LeBron is playing at this stage of his career compared to where Kareem was his last four years



Kareems peak was the 1970s which was an era overrun with cokeheads, a lot of the best players in basketball were in the ABA, there certainly was no dominant team that just stopped everybody else from winning, and he came out of that decade with only one championship, five MVPs yes ( but one of those he missed the playoffs so I think it's fair to say the MVP voting might have been a little sketchy with the players voting even though I would still say he deserved most of them)



And even when he started winning in the 80s it was because he had the greatest point guard of all time by his side, and I get that they needed each other but this was not a Jordan and Pippen situation, those Lakers teams were Magics right away, from Game 6 of those finals onward people will say Magic stole the 1980 Finals MVP but I would say Kareem stole the 85 Finals MVP from Magic so it evens out



Not to mention the idea of him being the automatic number three or consensus goat before Jordan was never consensus, I know it's only one publication but here is slam magazines top 75 list released in 2003

We are shifting to a new API, and started patching boxscore generator first. There are lots of things still to figure out regarding this new API so it may take some time to restore all the bots completely. Boxscore generator, eventhough fixed, still has lots of things that we can improve. Like the minutes column is little buggy. If a game havent started, page for that game won't open. These things we will try to fix soon. But for now it is atleast in usable state (I think).

We will not start enforcing embeded boxscore in PGT just yet, we hope the words get around quickly and users start using embeded boxscores. Probably next week we may post official announcement after which we may start enforcing embeded boxscore in PGT.

The rest are either, their 2 stars , washed up old players who gotta learn to play a style of basketball that’s friendlier to their older age or young players who are inconsistent and can’t yet bring a specific skill every night. 

When I look at their fellow LA team the Clippers, I see 2 stars and around 9 players who can consistently contribute a skill or two every single night.

-Rudy Gobert: 19.5 RPG, adding a much needed glass cleaner for the wolves

-Donovan Mitchell: 31 PTS 9 AST performance in his first game with the Cavs. Haven't seen much of him with Garland yet.

-James Harden: efficient 33/8/8, regaining his superstar status?

-Jaylen Brown: 31.5 PPG on an efficient 69% eFG, continues to prove himself a budding superstar pairing with Tatum.

-Paolo Banchero: 23/10/3 and 2.5 BPG is living up to his #1 pick status

-Brook Lopez: 17 PTS and showed elite defense back from injury against Embiid. Valuable championship piece for the Bucks

-Ivaca Zubac: 14/17/1 with 5 blocks, could he have a breakout year that gives the Clippers the edge?

-Ja Morant: 41/4/8, continuing his path to superstardom

-Pascal Siakam: 30/11/6, continues to overachieve and push his potential further

nba,"Doc Rivers had just recently said that Embiid has plantar fasciitis and he’s struggling early in the season so far. This has been the same routine for Embiid every year regarding him getting injured. Embiid is capable of being an MVP or MVP candidate this year like he did last season but his regular season output never translates to the postseason. 

Last season Joel averaged 30 but in the playoffs his scoring dropped down to 23 and in the ECSF vs the Heat Embiid averaged 19 on 42% shooting. Embiid has many other playoff games &amp; series where he isn’t good at all like in the 2019 ECSF vs the Raptors where he averaged 17 on 37%. 

Embiid’s teammate James Harden is known as a “playoff chocker” but the real playoff chocker is Embiid. In his prime on Harden’s worst days its better than Embiid in the playoffs. Embiid is overrated cause he’s viewed as better than players like Jokic which Jokic is miles above Embiid. 

I believe a healthy Kawhi &amp; AD is better than Embiid and with the way his teammate Harden is playing now Harden might be better. Embiid may not even be top 10 but in recent discussions many put Embiid top 5 in which he has no business up their. Embiid’s style of play isn’t a winning style cause his post up style is dinosaur like where that style isn’t suited for todays modern NBA. Todays NBA is only about spreading the ball with 3 shooters &amp; versatile players that can do multiple things. Also, Joel isn’t that efficient on post up situations and still struggles against quality skilled bigs like Horford &amp; Lopez and still doesn’t know how to handle doubles &amp; traps in the post as evidence of the first two games where the 76ers are 0-2 so far. 

Embiid is the most overrated player cause he consistently performs terribly come postseason &amp; is only a regular season player but yet is viewed as a top 5 over guys like Jokic, Curry, Lebron and KD and he isn’t over those guys, it’s even questionable if he’s a top 10 player",Joel Embiid is one of the most overrated players

nba,"I think most is avoiding getting fouls. Draymond Green, Rudy Gobert, and JJJ all were foul machines barely able to spend time on the court early in their careers and now they are maybe the best 3 defending bigmen in the NBA (some others may also have an argument). Examples of players who don't improve this tend to be the exception rather than the norm like Hasheem Thabeet.

I hear turnovers are like this as well, Devin Booker improved his turnovers vastly but many may state this is because he is playing with Chris Paul, regardless I think hard to deny he deserves a lot of that credit. I can't find as many examples as I can with personal fouls.

For least maybe rebounding. While I can find examples of people like Sabonis but he was a good rebounder in college and I think he just gained confidence and was more active as he became a better player (and also his role changed). I would be interested to see if JJJ ever becomes a good rebounder when he wasn't great at rebounding in college or his early career so far. Good rebounders like Gobert, KAT, Jokic, Embiid, Doncic, Embiid etc tended to be good at rebounding their whole career.

3 point shooting seems to be a mixed bag. I can find many examples of bigmen who improved this like Cousins, Paul Millsap, Al Horford, Chris Bosh, Channing Frye, Jonas Valanciunas, Nikola Vucevic but not so many with other positions. I think bigmen are the most likely to improve this because they were probably developing their post game more growing up while most other positions came into the NBA with more hours dedicated to try to develop this skill and either they have it or not by the time they enter the league.

I know you can find examples of players not improving and improving with every stat or skill but surely some skills tend to change less or more than others.",What skills and/or stats do players tend to improve the most/least?

nba,"I was doing some reading into old Wilt stories and found a [really insightful post](https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3kltjd/collection_of_wilt_chamberlain_foul_line_stories/) by /u/dantheman9758 with old stories about Wilt's foul shooting. Some players would intentionally try to get him to the line to mess with his head, and legitimately chase him around the court like they were playing tag. Here are some funny accounts about what other players would do to bully Wilt: 

* **BOB FERRY**

&gt; Wilt's free throw shooting led to some funny moments. At the end of the game, I'd tell Wilt, ""The minute you touch the ball, I'm gonna foul you."" That would piss him off. There were games where I'd try to foul him even when he didn't have the ball. I'd go after him and he'd run away as if we were playing tag. When I finally did foul him, I'd say, ""Wilt, you're gonna miss."" That really pissed him off. Then he'd go to the line, miss the shot and get even madder.

* **ALEX HANNUM**

&gt; In Johnny Kerr's first year coaching the Bulls, he ordered his team to foul Wilt every time in the fourth quarter, and the game became a travesty with Wilt running around and two Bulls chasing him even though the ball was nowhere around. Finally, I took Wilt out for the last few minutes. He was so damn tired from running from those guys just so he wouldn't get fouled.

* **ROD THORN**

&gt; Wilt was the reason they put in a rule to stop players from intentionally fouling away from the ball. Everyone was just grabbing Wilt and making the game last forever.

* ** WILT CHAMBERLAIN **

&gt; Bad News Barnes was with Baltimore and he was a big, rough-and-tumble guy, about 6-foot-9. We were in a close playoff game with them and Barnes's coach told him, ""Every time Wilt gets the ball, foul him."" I knew what was going on, so I set up about 35 feet from the basket. I caught a pass and Barnes came running at me. I put the ball down on the floor and said, ""You put your hands on me just once and I'm gonna knock you on your ass."" He stopped like he ran into a wall. I picked up the ball and passed off.

There's also a particularly fascinating story, where players would try and use an illegal sticky gel on the ball to improve their grip and also mess with Wilt in the process: 

* ** BOB FERRY **

&gt; Cliff Hagan and a lot of other players used stickum on their hands to get a better grip on the ball. Will claimed that was why he missed foul shots—the ball was too sticky. The league had a rule against stickum. So we started to hide the stuff on the side of our shoes, on our shorts. We'd go to the line, rub the side of our shoes, and Wilt would yell to the officials, ""Those guys are putting stickum on the ball."" The officials would check us and find nothing. Half the time, we didn't have anything. We just acted like we did to annoy Wilt.

There are a lot of other insightful interviews with past coaches and players about Wilt's free throw shooting in the original post, I highly recommend you check it out. Wilt was by multiple accounts a great free throw shooter in practice (75-80% from the line), but apparently just couldn't figure it out in game no matter what he tried and what method he used. You can really see the frustration come out whenever Wilt talks about it. Here's a final famous story Wilt once gave about seeing a psychiatrist about foul shooting:

&gt; I was once a good free throw shooter. Cute little story - I went to a psychiatrist for about a month on my free throw situation. After a month, I gave it up. Somebody else paid for the session, $50 a session. I won’t say it who. After I came out with it for a whole month, the psychiatrist was a better free throw shooter than I was.",Wilt Chamberlain was Bullied on the Court by Players because of his Free Throw Shooting

nba,"Everyone's talking about how amazing it is to see so many guys back finally healthy across the league. We all know the names and I'm right there with them on being ecstatic about this. The problem is guys getting hurt purely from wear and tear having to play the majority of an overly long season.

An **82** Game Regular Season. 

The Pre- Season is another **4** Games generally.

The Post- Season if you go all the way to game 7 of the Finals is **28**, not including the Play in.

Thats about **114** potential games in a season not including the playing or summer league.

If you're a younger team like Orlando or Detroit, you're probably not going to be in the playoffs BUT your starters are probably going to see a good amount of playing time in that summer league and pre-season games. **Ultimately EVERYONE that's a starting caliber player** is going to see a significant amount of playing time leading to a lot of wear and tear and the eventual Every Single Season getting hurt types of cases. 

***These players aren't staying healthy for entire seasons for a reason. Superstars and basic starters alike.***

This is where the in-season Cup tournament could actually make a difference. It sounds like the tournament will be held mostly in a single month, November iv heard. An 8 team single elimination will be in December, so that's **3 more games**. If you play normally 3 to 4 games a week, **your team will play 12 to 16 games in a single month**. 

82 Regular season games. Make the Cup tournament About 20 games long. Cool Right. Exclude All Normal Starters From Every Team OR Players that have already played over a certain Minutes per Game Threshold up to the beginning of the Cup Tournament. 

**Load Management for your teams 5 bigger name players: Brand Exposure and Development time for your 10 Other lesser name players. 2 G-League Call ups for each team to fill out a 12-man Cup Tournament Roster for the potential 20ish games they play.** 

The Incentives would be ample by doing it this way. 

1. Your best players get a chance to rest their body's to varying lengths of time depending on how your Cup Roster does. Your normal starters will get anywhere from 12 to maybe as high as 20 games to let their ankles and hamstrings and so forth recover before the next big stretch of the season. Thats far better health wise then just giving these guys a game off here and there like they are machines or something. Think about Ja, Zion, Khawi, Murray, Nurkic, Luka and so on of your superstar on down to basic starter level players. 
2. **The rumored 1 Million per player cash prize** would definitely light a fire for more high-level basketball from those lesser-known players then it would for guys that are already on 100+ million-dollar contracts anyway. 1 Million is a lot to anybody but those starters still wouldn't be AS driven by it as the guys on notably smaller deals. 
3. ***Even the last player in the second round of the NBA draft is one of the greatest players in the world when you think about how exclusive of a league the NBA is.*** These aren't soccer or football teams that have 30 to 50+ guys on every single one of them. A full NBA roster is only 15 guys and those bottoms 5 are fringe players. **The worst guys in the league are actually Phenomenal Talents amongst the world.** Having this Cup tournament focused on them from a marketing standpoint is honestly genius and would catch fire within the first couple seasons of holding the tournament this way. From a fan perspective, it gives us the chance to see what these guys can do more. For the players, its as simple as more opportunity for them to stay in the league.
4. **Make the Championship Prize A Choice known as ""The Decision""** of either A. Guaranteed Play-In or Playoff Spot or B. Guaranteed additional 1st round Pick. If your a team that's already doing well enough to make the playoffs, you'll probably pick the Draft Pick. Vice versa, If your a team that knows it'll just lose in the playoffs or even play in, it would be an additional 1st round pick for you. If your a team that's in the stacked west for example, you could use this as an opportunity to strategically push another playoff team down to the play in tournament as you take that playoff spot. There's so many ways this decision by the winner of this cup would have major importance and implications thus giving the Cup Tournament itself major importance.

This would force organizations to develop more well-rounded and deep teams instead of a top heavy team where if you lose a single person suddenly the seasons lost, and you just went from a contender to a lottery team. 

When Giannis and the bucks won the championship there was a lot of luck involved in them even getting there. When the Lakers won it in the Bubble, again a lot of luck involved. There's always going to be luck involved BUT compare those Bucks and Lakers teams to the Tim Duncan Spurs teams or the 04 Detroit Pistons teams. 

The Spurs and the Pistons were honestly deep teams while the other two in those particular years were very top heavy. There was far less luck involved with the dominance of those Spurs and Piston teams because they were so well built all the way down.

**The playoffs are far more exciting when half of the top players Aren't Injured because of excessive workloads in a very high paced game.** Each team is far more exciting when you care more about the whole roster more but as it currently is, why should you care that much about player number 11 through 15 on the team? Why should you care at all about who the top players on your G-League affiliate are?

Rest your top players and guard their health while elevating the importance of the rest of your teams' players. There are over 100 games to work with as I broke it down earlier. I could go more in depth with any points I've made here but this is already long enough and I'm not even getting paid for this lol

&gt; I love Rudy Gobert. He truly is an incredible player.
&gt; 
&gt; However.
&gt; 
&gt; When he makes these choices, when he is a bit reluctant to leave the paint, you can exploit it. And that’s what the Jazz did at the end of the fourth quarter, turning a 4-point deficit into a 7-point lead. Steve Jones Jr., one of the best follows on Twitter, tweeted out this quick little highlight video of it:

&gt;     DO YOU WANT TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION OR NAH pic.twitter.com/bnal7pAExj
&gt;     — Steve Jones Jr. (@stevejones20) October 22, 2022
&gt; 
&gt; • On that first Jordan Clarkson three, Gobert’s absolutely in no man’s land. He’s not contesting Clarkson’s shot, nor getting to the threat of Kelly Olynyk out top. I am, again, truly a believer that Gobert can guard the perimeter — but he’s really not doing anything for his team here.
&gt; 
&gt; • Second play? Olynyk’s Gobert’s man. There’s no reason for him to dive down to the paint. Olynyk’s the threat. He’s gotta guard it — and he doesn’t.
&gt; 
&gt; • Third play ... again, watch Gobert. What’s he doing here? The Defensive Player of the Year is so good when he’s engaged in the play. When he’s standing in the middle of the court, it’s not valuable.
&gt; 
&gt; • And on the fourth play, he’s moved to guard Markkanen, the Jazz screen Gobert out of the play on the perimeter, the Wolves don’t figure out the switch, and the result is Conley driving to the rim with no help at all.
&gt; 
&gt; Look, I covered Gobert for nine seasons. If this happened in those nine seasons, I would absolutely lead off this Triple Team essentially writing-screaming at him to get more involved in these plays. He’s a very good perimeter defender! But just watching isn’t an option: he can play excellent defense a full two steps closer to the screen, still lock down the paint, and make an impact on these shots.
&gt; 
&gt; And this is one frustrating thing about Rudy: he indisputably goes through these lulls where he does just kind of lurk rather than attack. The difference is stark.

nba,"Wiggins was awesome defensively again tonight and continues to fulfill his promise about rebounding like he did in the playoffs. He was also good finishing around the rim tonight and even with an off shooting night was still able to make a good offensive contribution, despite the loss.

In game 1 against the Lakers he dropped 20/6/4 on 57/57/0 splits and showed that he picked up right where he left off in the playoffs.

His averages through two games so far this season are 22/7/4/2/1 on 52/40/71 splits (63% true shooting). 

Being fully ingratiated in the Warriors system now after 2.5 seasons along confidence gained from his all star + championship season and alleviated burden from his new contract, he’s simply playing more loose and carefree and the results beat that out thus far.

Jazz beat Wolves in OT behind contributions from every single one of their players 2018-2019 Brooklyn Nets style. 

Mike Conley shows he was a part of the Grit and Grind Grizzlies by sacrificing his body at the end to make sure Gobert doesn't get the dunk as he fouls him and then Gobert misses both free throws at the line and then Lauri Markannen, the Finnish GOAT hits the dagger to seal the win for the Utah Jazz.

Dame scores 43 points en route to an OT victory against the Suns with Anfernee Simons hitting a running hook shot game winner over Mikal Bridges.

Kyrie and KD come up clutch against the Raptors and bury them despite Siakam's 37 point triple double. 

Nic Claxton had 2 coast to coast layups in transition, one with a eurostep. He also grabbed 11 total rebounds with 7 being offensive rebounds and blocked 4 shots.

Warriors nearly pull off a 20 point comeback behind Curry's 34 and Wiggins and Draymond's amazing play on both ends but Nuggets manage to stay in it and hold them off despite the 4th quarter heroics of the Warriors. 

Side note: Free Moses Moody. He does not deserve to be benched for Donte DiVicenzo.

The Celtics beat the Heat as Bam Adebayo is called for three (3!) moving screens in the game. And one of them was an absolutely nasty moving screen even for his standards.

Sam Hauser held up well on defense surprisingly and Tatum looks like he's aiming for that MVP.

Ja Morant scored 49 points on 5/6 from 3 and got a few chasedown blocks as he led the Grizzlies to victory over the Jalen Green and Alperen Sengun led Rockets with three of his starting caliber players not playing (JJJ, Dillon Brooks, Ziare Williams) and Bane not being at his best.

The Hawks - Magic game was pretty close too till the middle of 4th where the Hawks took over and secured the win. Another nice game by Paolo Banchero who looks like the front runner for ROTY as of now.

The Pistons starting lineup held up well and looked good against the Knicks but their bench was extremely bad and the Knicks ended up blowing them out behind efficient games by Jalen Brunson (0 TO, 6 AST) and RJ Barrett (18 PTS, 54% FG).

Spurs inbound. Pacers foul. 3.4 seconds left.
Tre Jones knocks down both FTs. 3 point deficit once again. Pacers call timeout. 

And then after playing absurd the whole 4th quarter, Pacers absolutely shit the bed on the last possesion.

3 guys - Buddy Hield, Haliburton (inbounder)  and Bennedict Mathurin all stand on the right wing leading to absolutely no space for Mathurin to get a comfortable shot and it results in an airball.

In my humble opinion, Haliburton should not have been the inbounder, or even if he was the inbounder, the ball should've been passed back to him right away so the undisputed best player who had 18 points in the 4th quarter can take the shot. 

Or you can have Buddy Hield, the best shooter on the team take it if you don't want Haliburton to take it because of him shooting 20% from three in this game. Hield shot 50% from three in this game by the way.

&amp;#x200B;

I truly believe the only option for the Lakers is to also get rid of Davis. I don't see how they will get any better with their current roster unless they get a lot more than anyone is willing to give up for  Westbrook alone.

This trade probably helps the Spurs more than anything, since it makes the Lakers better and them significantly worse (but only for this season**)**, increasing their chances of getting Wembanyama.",The only option for the Lakers this season is to blow it up and get as much value as they can for Westbrook and Davis

From Mourning’s post:

&gt;Thanking God this morning!

&gt;My brotha is on the mend and in good spirits!!! Thank you all for your thoughts and prayers. Prayer is truly uplifting. 🙏🏾

This isn’t the first time one of the Georgetown bigs showed up in support of an ailing brother: 

After Alonzo Mourning was diagnosed with a kidney ailment in 2000, Ewing promised that he would donate one of his kidneys to Mourning if he ever needed one and was even tested for kidney compatibility with Mourning. Mourning eventually received a new kidney from a distant cousin.",[Marc J.

nba,"Last year the Lakers only wanted players older than 35. This year they seem to be only signing guys who shoot under 32% from 3.

I feel like they’re playing a handicap roster building game. What should their handicap be next year? I’m thinking only players shorter than 6’3”",Last year Lakers roster requirement was to be older than 35. This year it’s to shoot under 32% from 3. What will their requirement be next year?

I'll spare the overly long intro from the first time and give this abbreviated version- starting in 1960, this series looks to go through the history of the NBA and revote on the hall of fame classes, while adopting the rules from baseball's hall of fame. (10 years on the ballot, 75%+ for induction, less than 5% and you're off.) Every voter is free to apply their own standards- you can care about or disregard character, college accomplishments or international ones. I'll provide very very limited summaries of player's accomplishments if you decide you want to read through it... or not! Most of us aren't super familiar with the 50's/60's game. If you want to read my ramblings in a little more detail, [here's the link to the original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/x8h29g/hall_of_fame_doover_starting_in_1960_how_would/). The mods got back to me and gave me a thumbs up, so I'll try to post the new ballot every Monday, Wednesday and Friday if you want to try to keep up and have your uh very important voice on very old NBA players be heard.

#Class of 1978

One first timer stands above the rest this year! Celtics small forward **John Havlicek** cruises into our hall of fame, collecting 95.5% of the vote, as our only inductee this year. However, others were close! Former teammates Dave Bing and Walt Bellamy both come close, falling in at 68.2% of the vote. Behind them, in a very distant fourth, is Gus Johnson, who collected only 36.4% of the vote.

The newcomers not named Bing or Havlicek didn't have a good stay- Cazzie Russell, Dale Schlueter, Curtis Perry, Steve Kuberski, Tom Boerwinkle and Zaid Abdul Aziz all disappeared. Jim Fox and Tom Van Arsdale both disappear as well, having survived their first stay on the ballot, while Jeff Mullins and Rick Adelman fall off at last.

nba,"In the 2021 off-season, the Lakers traded away a few key role players for Westbrook, basically forming a super team. Despite the hit in depth and lack of shooters, some believed that the star power would be enough to carry the lakers that season. Moreover, Westbrook would in theory run the offense while Lebron was resting. 

However, this did not work out, and the Lakers were terrible this season. So terrible, that fans have wanted Westbrook traded all off-season long. Despite this.... the big three is still intact, so the Lakers are still categorized as a ""super team"" this season (even if it's not a good one). 

The Lakers tried to solve their issues with shooting by basically signing no shooters and letting one of their better shooters walk (monk). Now this team is even worse than what it was last season and the Lakers could very well be a lottery team despite having both AD and Lebron.

What’s it like guarding the toughest player on a nightly basis? 
&gt; I go into every game with one mindset, and that’s to make it as tough as possible on the opposing player I’m guarding or team to score. I know these guys are getting paid a lot of money to score. It’s my job, and my teammates rely on me to make it tough for these guys to score. That’s what I go out and do. I know they’re going to make tough shots, but it doesn’t bother me at all. It’s another possession they’ll have to come down and work for. My mindset is I want to be relentless on the defensive end no matter how many shots someone makes. I want them to know it’s going to be tough every time.

***""If Russ hadn't played, would the Lakers have won?""***

I think the obvious answer is ""yes"". He hurts the team much more than he helps them, and there is no longer any ""high ceiling"" to hope to reach when he is playing at his best. 

He's not the only problem the Lakers have (Pelinka's failures are the real issue, to be honest), but he is the most pressing one and the first one that needs to be fixed. 

In the current Lakers system, Russ is one of the worst players on the team.

The Lakers would be better with nothing for Russ, and hence they would also be better with very little in exchange.  If Bron and AD are (relatively healthy), they get one more shooter and a big, and they use a good line-up, they can be very competitive. 

Hence, Pelinka needs to stop waiting to get the most out a great trade. Every moment he waits for that, Bron's career comes closer to and end and AD's fragile body further deteriorates.

nba,"4 full seasons have gone by since Lonzo Ball released the diss track ""Kylie Kuzma"". In the song Lonzo mentions that Kuzma doesn't have a shoe deal and brags about how much money BBB is making. Basically the song calls Kuzma a weak individual for two minutes straight. Flash forward 4 years...

Lonzo gets traded from the Lakers and Pelicans, only plays in 200 games, and is very injury prone. Kuzma on the other hand wins a championship and plays in 266 games with his skills increasing each year. 

I think it's fair to say Kuzma got the last laugh on Lonzo since the diss track was released",Kyle Kuzma got the last laugh on Lonzo since the release of the diss track Kylie Kuzma in 2018
nba,"&gt; While the Kings dropped their regular season opener to Portland on Wednesday (115-108), Fox showed out in a major way. By finishing with 33 points, seven assists and seven rebounds, he became the first player in franchise history to hit the 30-5-5 marks in a season opener since Oscar Robertson in 1966 (he also had eight turnovers, which was one off of his career high). Beyond Fox’s big night, Brown’s debut was a clear reminder at the start that his defensive vision for this group won’t be easily achieved.

&gt; But the prevailing theme of this Kings season is clear. Help Fox have the best two-way season of his career. Give him new help in the form of a teammate from Kentucky, Malik Monk, former Atlanta guard Kevin Huerter and promising rookie Keegan Murray. And if all goes according to plan, help validate Fox’s decision to stay loyal to a small market team that has been believing in him for so many years now.

&gt; “I’ve never been the type of person that wants a big market,” Fox said. “(So) if I can go to a small market, and then win, those are the types of things that I feel like are more important to me. It’s being able to bring winning back to the city. That is definitely my goal.”

nba,"I’m by no means a Westbrook hater.  I’m fairly new to the nba. Didn’t really start watching till around 2014.  So watching him develop as a player has been awesome.

Second. I’m a pistons fan.  I don’t care about the lakers. I don’t care about 90% of the league as we haven’t won anything or have rivalries with anyone in the last 2 decades.


To begin.  Westbrook should be a bench player.  He’s not able to go out. Put up 20+ points and be efficient in playmaking.  He never was “efficient” when it came playmaking. But when you average 11+ assist no one’s really going to care about the TO.  But now, when he averages around 7. Those 3 TO look horrible.  I don’t get why the lakers won’t put him on the bench.  If he comes out and scores 13 with a couple assists great.  If he’s doing stupid shit like he’s known todo. Good. He’s only able to hinder the team for a limited time.

But now I’m seeing more and more people defend him.  I don’t know how you can watch him play. And every play there’s a 30% chance the ball is going to hit the shot clock or be launched into the third row.  And say, “yeah but he’s being scapegoated”. Dog he’s the 3 in the lakers big 3.  The teams trash outside of them.

The only other person who can be blamed is AD. Bro is hurt constantly. Also shooting 12% from 3 is horrible.  But guess what. AD is there best defender by far and offered something.  What does Westbrook offer? Inefficient scoring. Inefficient playmaking. And mid defense at best.  So yeah. He’s going to be blamed. The other 2 guys do so much more for the team. Westbrook on a routinely bases is a negative to the team in almost every aspect. Why are we defending a dude making 47 million to be out preformed by John Wall who hasn’t played in 567 days and was on the verge of being retired.",Criticism towards Westbrook is deserved

You run the offense not at the 3 point line but top of the key / free throw. You get cutters all around. Standing in the mid range gives players a chance to set picks for cutters to drive to the paint.

nba,"Rules are simple, unleash your inner hater and let the world know who and why you hate in the league the most. It’s all good and noble to be a fan of a player because of some silly reason like “they are good at basketball”, but it’s way more fun to hate on players. 

Some guidelines are that you should explain why you hate a certain players game or personality in particular. Just because they always go off against your team is a weak reason.

Additionally, just like when building a real team, better players should take preference.    For example, hating nniang because he bricks threes in the playoffs is pretty weak hating. 

Without further ado, here’s mine: 

1. Kevin Durant 

This one is pretty simple, he gives me taking the ball home when he’s losing vibes.  Joining the warriors just seems like an all time loser move that caused me to stop watching basketball from 2017-2020. It’s crazy how a competitive league makes for a better product, and I blame KD for how sad the nba was for a time. 

2. Kyrie Irving

Another simple one, I hate not being able to just sit back and enjoy one of the more entertaining players in the league play basketball without thinking about how he’s a colossal dumbass and a negative to society. Also pure isoball without a playmaker next to kyrie just feels like a losing formula. I.e Devin booker without chris paul

3. James Harden + 4. Joel Embiid 

I lumped these two together because my beef with them is basically the same. Two of the most skilled and exciting players to watch….when they aren’t foul baiting. Except for the fact that they ARE always foul baiting. It makes 76ers basketball unwatchable to me. I get it, it’s a skill and it helps their teams win, but it’s not a skill I respect or find entertaining like stephs shooting or lebrons passing. Also both players have a huge victim complex ( shoutout James Harden for posting his stats on Twitter with the captain “stay humble”, that was great lol)

5. Draymond Green

Love what he brings on the court as a basketball player, but he’s downright annoying. The dirty plays, the way he talks like he would be relevant if he wasn’t on the warriors, making a documentary about punching his teammate??? Idk just not a likeable guy. 

Honorable mentions:

Devin Booker: 
 for also being a whiny child but just like at basketball, KD clears in this regard

Russel Westbrook:
 Feel bad for kicking him when he’s down, but even back to okc days the terrible bbiq, bad shots, empty stats, and lack of awareness and willingness to accept criticism has always bothered me

Anthony Davis:
*while falling* “ayyeeeUUUAAHHHHH”

But his defense held him back. In his sophomore season Zion was one of the worst defenders in the league. I remember him getting repeatedly cooked by Georges Niang and other role players. 

Seems like so far this isn't the case? In preseason and the opener Zion looked decent on that end. Granted his primary assignment was noted offensive liability Ben Simmons, but he had some solid help and positioning to help him snag four steals. He bottled up Kyrie on a few possessions as well. 

There were some possessions where he was a bit lazy. The effort still isn't entirely there, possibly because Zion's still getting accustomed to NBA basketball after a long break.

It's pretty interesting seeing the actual discrepancy with Randle and a PG. I think Randle is a solid player but he plays with a lot of emotion. When things aren't going his way, you often see him lose his cool and start barreling into the lane and making stupid defensive plays. This past season was the first time in front of full stadiums and with much, much more media coverage (even for NY) because they over performed the year before. They tried to run the offense through him and play Burks/Fournier in the backcourt to add shooting but those two, RJ, Mitch are a bunch of guys who aren't equipped to be #2, and Julius isn't equipped to be #1 which made things worse. This is why the Knicks paid Brunson, a guy who can hold the ball and be consistent unlike their guards of the past.

Hopefully Randle can go back his 20/21 form. I think him, RJ, and Brunson can be solid 2/3/4 options with a bunch of prospects projecting to be very good role players.

nba,"I remember in my high school tennis team, teams had to decide who would play 1st singles, 2nd singles, 3rd singles, etc. 1st singles was supposed to be your best guy, 2nd singles was your 2nd best, etc.  It was illegal to ""stack"" your lineup, which is where you put your worst guys at 1st and 2nd singles and start playing your best guys at number 3, 4, 5, etc. The reason this is tempting is that if your team is worse at every position, you'd be expected to lose every match. But if you stack your lineup, you can have your 1st guy and 2nd guys pummeling their 3rd or 4th guys and then you have a better chance at winning more matches and pulling off the upset.

To compare, **LeBron James** since coming into the league played all **82** games in a season only once and played 80+ games in 3 of them.

**LeBron James** was the same early in his career, averaging **40+** in 4 consecutive seasons, then hitting **39+** once and then dropped lower and lower because his team was just better constructed overall, so he didn't need to play as much.","In Michael Jordan's 15 seasons in the NBA, he played all 82 games in 9 and 80+ in 11 of them!"

nba,"So I’m a cavs fan…and the opinion I’m about to give would pretty much get me banned on the Cavs sub…which is a sad state of affairs…but anyways …here it is 

This dude has extreme limitations offensively. I watched all of his games last year and I attributed it to age and lack of experience. But the more I watch- the more I notice a complete lack of body control, awful ball handling ( like really really bad), he is not a good shooter and lacks aggression. 

That said- he does have a great frame, seems to be of high character and I think I read about him having a solid work ethic. Furthermore, he’s a very good defender. 

But I wanted to ask a more objective fan base. Many cavs fans consider him a franchise cornerstone future top 10 player. I don’t even think there’s a 2% chance of this.  I see his ceiling as a 16-18 ppg- 8 rebounds- 1.5-2 bpg. This is a solid player for sure…but I’m not seeing anything special. Thoughts?",Mobley and my honest thoughts

nba,"In a highly unlikely event that Lakers will somehow finish in top 3, I do think Lebron James can get away with MVP. Here is why:


1) He is protected to break Kareem's once unreachable record. MVP needs naratives, and t will make him seem better than he actually would be in the eyes of the media. 

2) He just effortlessly put 34/12/8 which could ďeasily be 34/12/12 if they have anyone that can make threes. He can average a slightly stat padding triple double at age 38 if he wants to. Fair or not, his longevity and age will be the second narrative. 

3).Perception of the Lakers. Right now, they are a team that is poorly constructed. 10 player from last years team is still unsigned. They couldn't even make the playoff. If they make a trade for Cavs 2018 like roster with shooting and zero defence other than AD, they will have enough fire power having the most efficent play in NBA with AD/Lebron PnR surrounded by 3 shooters. In this scenario, they can get into first 3 in the conference as it will constitute a great regular season team. So, he will be seen as the one who turned it around. 

4) Legacy Games. He is just good at that, like just before the bubble season when he shut down Kawhi and Giannis at back to back games. He is gonna pick and choose, if he wants the MVP. 

So what about the front runners?  

1).Luka has the 2 and 4 down and a better team around him. But if Lebron would break the record and have the same or better averages in a subpar team, he will have the narrative. I think that Luka is better, at this stage, than Lebron, and clear favourite for the MVP, he just doesn't have the narrative. 

2) Jokic - Best player in the NBA with Giannis, but voter fatigue. 

3) Embiid - If he stays healthy, the fact that he lost last year and Jokic is out of the race will help his narrative. It is weird to award someone this years MVP for something that happened last year, but this is how it happens in NBA. It will depend on if the voters value defence or faciliating more. He won't have any historical breakthroughs like Lebron will, and his counting stats may lower with a healthy, iso Harden back in the game. But this is a though one, because there is a huge chance that they will be the first in the Eastern Conference. 

4) Giannis. He is the best player in NBA, probably the Defensive Player of the year every season.  He will have the same handicups as others.

I think voters will favour Lebron breaking Kareems record and playing at such a high level at 38 over unhumanly, but excepted performance from others. 

If Lakers somehow sneak into top three, and no other stars has a breakthrough (Luka coming in shape, averaging triple, finishing first etc), Lebron is gonna be in the MVP race, and one or two games in his favour (Remember 2008 when Lakers beat Hornest at the penultimate game of the season which net Kobe the MVP) I think he is gonna win it. 

One thing to consider: This roster is not gonne win the chip, and I think LeBron is very aware of that. So it could be the only season since 2013 that he focuses on Regular Season to break Kareems record. 

What do you think? Could he be in the MVP race? Does it make sense to use Longevity and Historic Records when evaluation the regular season? And above all, will he care enough to wore himself down?",MVP Dark Horse: LeBron James

Alot has been made of Lebron and how he is all but guaranteed to break Kareems all-time scoring record this season and how he has the best longevity of all time.

And rightfully so, what Lebron has and will accomplish is at minimum one of the 2 greatest careers in NBA history. However, Kareem at age 30 had 18,638 points, this means Kareem had 19749 AFTER HE TURNED 30.

At 35 Kareem had 28,028 so he still had over 10,000 points left in his career.

If Kareem had been able to come out of high school directly into the NBA at 18 like other all time greats such as Lebron, Kobe or KG instead of at 22 when he was the greatest college player of all time his total point record would likely be over 40,000.",Kareems longevity

**Background**

When people think about Bill Russell's legacy, it always goes back to winning 11 championships, a feat so incredible it matches up with any of Wilt's ridiculous records. Yet while people acknowledge the greatness involved with that much winning, they also have a lot of doubts about how much of the 60's Celtics dynasty can be attributed to Bill Russell as an individual talent, and how much is on the back of how great his supporting cast and coaching was. You can see this whenever a thread about Bill Russell pops up on here; yes, he won eleven, but he was supposed to win that much. The Celtics were just that much better than everyone else.

However, 1968-69 is the year no one can dare to make that claim. Sam Jones, the second best scoring guard of the 60's and offensive punch to Russell's defensive grip, was 35 and on his last legs. Hall of Famers of Celtics' past like Tom Heinsohn, Frank Ramsey, and K.C Jones had retired. And Russell himself was 34, clinically diagnosed with exhaustion from the added wear and tear of being both a starting player and the team's coach. He was also battling a knee injury for most of the season, which had put him in the hospital and kept him out for a number of games.

On a personal level, Russell was struggling with his marriage to his first wife. He had also become more disillusioned by the corruption found in the country he lived in due to events like the assassination of Robert Kennedy, and felt he was wasting his time by playing something as trivial as basketball. He was 15 pounds overweight going into the season, and missed multiple mandatory NBA coaches meeting due to a lack of motivation. This, along with the age and bodily fatigue, lead him to privately inform Celtics GM and long time friend Red Auerbach that this was to be his *last season, win or lose*. 

**Celtics Season**

The Celtics finished 48-34, the worst record of Russell's career. They barely squeaked into the playoffs, finishing 4th in the East, and the teams that finished in front of them (Bullets, 76ers, Knicks) were 57, 55 and 54 win teams respectively. Whoever made it out of the East was expected to face the newly assembled Lakers superteam comprised of Wilt, West and Elgin Baylor. No one in the media gave any real favor or attention to Russell and the aging Boston Celtics. 

In one of the greatest playoff runs in NBA history, the Celtics ran through the 2nd seed Sixers in 5 games, and then beat the Knicks, lead by Willis Reed and Walt Frazier, in 6. The Celtics won the final Game 6 by a single point, and in that game Russell put up *12/21/5 on 60 FG%*. For the whole series, Russell averaged *16.3/20.8/5.2 on 48 FG%*, up from his regular season averages of *9.9/19.3/4.9 on 43 FG%*. 

**1969 NBA Finals**

In the Finals, the Celtics were up against a Lakers team favored 3 to 1 to win. Since Russell had joined the Celtics, the Lakers had gone 0-7 to them in Finals matchups. A motivated Jerry West and Elgin Baylor were desperate for revenge, and hungry to give the city of Los Angeles its first title. 

This would be also be Russell's final matchup against the Big Dipper, Wilt Chamberlain. Wilt had suffered an embarrassing loss to the Celtics the year before, in which his 76ers had, for the first time in NBA history, blown a 3-1 lead in the playoffs. Finding himself in a situation where he had far better talent around him than Russell's, and still in the twilight of his prime coming off of his 3rd consecutive MVP season, Wilt was also confident that he could deliver Russell the third playoffs loss of his career. 

The Celtics went down 2-0 immediately, getting torched by Jerry West who dropped 53 and 41 in Games 1 and 2. The Celtics came back with a 111-105 victory in Game 3. In Game 4, the Lakers were on the cusp of going up 3-1, leading the game by 1 point with 7 seconds left on the clock. Sam Jones then made a last second buzzer beater which bounced straight up off the rim and into the basket, tying up the series. Game 5 the Lakers solidly won 117-104 behind West's 39 points. The Celtics barely held on in Game 6 at home, winning 99-90 and bringing the series to a Game 7 in Los Angeles. 

Before Game 7, Lakers management were so confident that owner Jack Kent Cooke ordered thousands of balloons be hung up from the ceiling with the words ""World Champion Lakers"" printed on them, which would then be released after the imminent Lakers win. Not only that, but flyers were placed in every seat stating, “When, not if, the Lakers win the title, balloons will be released from the rafters, the USC marching band will play “Happy Days Are Here Again.""""

When the Celtics caught word of what was going on, Bill Russell simply said to Jerry West, *""Those fucking balloons are staying up there.""*

The Celtics won a nailbiter Game 7 with a final score of 108-106, despite Jerry West going nuclear and putting up 42/13/12. Russell had won the first finals in the NBA history from down 0-2, and completed arguably the greatest underdog playoff run the game has seen. Here's an [ecstatic Bill Russell after the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksE7N78a9ds), now with more rings than fingers, ready to retire from the NBA as a champion once again. Russell in the series with the Lakers averaged *9.1/21.1/5.1*. While John Havlicek was the undeniable star of the Celtics (26/9/5), Russell still anchored the Celtics defense as well as he ever did, and *lead his team in assists through the series* because of the team's lack of a quality point guard. 

**Conclusion**

1969 is probably the biggest year of Bill Russell's career in terms of defining his greatness. This was a year where the odds were clearly stacked against him, facing teams clearly favored and better than his. Personal issues, age, and health issues plagued him and the Celtics throughout the season. They barely even made it into the playoffs! And despite everything, Russell still did what he did for his entire career: made his teammates better, and ended up the winner. 

In his final season, Russell also made All-NBA All Defensive First Team, finished 4th in MVP voting, and lead his team to one last banner. The following year after he retired, the Celtics would go 34-48 and miss the playoffs.",1969: Bill Russell's Miracle Last Season

This team could easily be 0-5 based on who they play in their next few games and given what happened this off-season, I have a bad feeling it will get ugly. I might be in the minority amongst Nets fans but I feel like you need to blow this team up. KD wants out and is only still here because he signed a 4 year extension that he now regrets. Kyrie doesn’t want to be here because he’s thrown a hissy fit since front office and ownership are trying to hold him accountable for his dumbass persona off the court. Simmons probably doesn’t want to be here either. It’s like they built a super team but with the three worst guys possible in terms of personality. That’s my feeling as a fan and I’m wondering if most fans of other teams feel the same way on the outside looking in. Another thing I’ll add to my feeling that this needs to be blown up is I can’t stand the social media trashing off this team. Granted, it’s deserved but it’s hard seeing a team you’ve rooted for since childhood be relatively mediocre to downright unwatchable and then finally get good and completely underachieve to the delight of r/nba and NBA Twitter nephews","From an outside perspective, do you think it’s best that the Nets complete tear down the roster and rebuild?"

Very goo debut for the #1 pick. Looked very capable on the offensive side and held his own on defense. Showed some pretty good playmaking flashes and was really good at finishing around the rim. Didn't attempt a single 3, but hopefully will have that in his arsenal. 

Also is the fourth player in the last 30 seasons to record at least 20p/5r/5a in his NBA debut along with Grant Hill, Lebron James and Michael Carter-Williams. Led the game in scoring.",Paolo Banchero In His NBA Debut: 27 PTS / 5 AST / 9 REB (35 Minutes)

nba,"I had NBA LP last year, though I had an international version of it. Here's some of the highlights this year:

    The NBA blocked international versions of League Pass. You can't buy it a cheaper price anymore through international versions and have 0 blackouts. I can understand why they did this, but this is a major problem for me because I'm blacked out from a team I don't believe I can actually watch any other way since I'm not in their area.

    LP used to allow you to choose your video quality. It no longer allows you to and runs at the highest quality possible. I usually can have about 6-10 720p videos running at one time with no problem, so I don't have a slow pc. But one LP stream plus any heavy CPU intensive program and the game is unwatchable.

    This year, LP decided to make the controls stay on the screen at all times. For some teams, the controls cover up the quarter, length and the shot clock.

    Speaking of controls, IIRC, LP also used to have some option where you could click on other games easily with the controls. They removed that option.

    The NBA also deleted years worth of games during the offseason. You used to be able to watch back to 2012-2014 or so. Every game since then was on there. Now, there's only games from 2019 on. Apparently, you can see them all on the app, but it sucks to lose features for no damn good reason.

And the best part about all of this is that the NBA redid the whole service this year to supposedly improve things.",The web version of NBA League-Pass is not good this year

nba,"Pretty much the title. A team with KD, Kyrie, Simmons failed to score more than 15 pts in a quarter",Brooklyn just scored 14 points in the first quarter
nba,"Last night on the TNT broadcast, Stan Van Gundy routinely bemoaned that fouling a 3P shooter, saying that it turns a ""40% shot into an 80% shot"". However, this isn't exactly mathematically correct. 

We can do the correct calculation using probability and the mathematics of expected value. The EV of a 3 point shot, in the hands of a 40% 3P shooter, is 1.2, since we expect the 3 points to come 40% of the time - 0.4 \* 3 = 1.2 **points per possession**

We can compute the EV of a trip to the FT line for an 80% FT shooter, and then back calculate to find what the percentage would be if the shot was just a 3-pointer. 

Consider the possibilities when a FT shooter goes to the FT line for 3 free throws. Either 3 misses, 2 misses 1 make, 1 miss 2 makes, or 3 makes. We can calculate the expected value of each of these possibilities: EV = probability of event \* points we get if that event happens.

If a FT shooter shoots with 80% accuracy, the probability of a make is 0.8 and the probability of a miss is 0.2. This is known as a binomial probability (2 outcomes, a weighted coin flip)

The probability of 3 makes is (0.8)^(3) = 0.512

The probability of 2 makes, 1 miss is (0.8)^(2) \* (0.2) = 0.192

The probability of 2 misses, 1 make is (0.2)^(2) \* (0.8) = 0.032

The probability of 3 misses is (0.2)^(3) = 0.008

So the EV of a 3 FT trip is (0.512 \* 3) + (0.192 \* 2) + (0.032 \* 1) + (0.008 \* 0) = **1.952 points per possession**

If we wanted to put this in terms of a 3-point shot, we could just divide by 3 (reversing our calculation of the expected value of a 3 point shot above). 1.952/3 = **0.65, or a 65% 3P shot**

TLDR: When you foul a 80% FT, 40% 3P shooter shooting a 3 and send him to take 3 FTs, The expected value increase jumps from **1.2** to **1.952**. In other words, it's **turning a 40% 3P shot into a 65% 3P shot, NOT a 80% 3P shot.**","[OC] Stan Van Gundy wrong when he said fouling a 3P shooter makes it an ""80% shot"""

nba,"Has anyone had success with the official NBA data API recently? I'm talking about [this one](https://github.com/kshvmdn/nba.js/blob/master/docs/api/DATA.md) with the associated endpoints. It was working last fall, and I really need it for a project.

The problem I'm running into is that a request to get the list of a day's games isn't showing all the data like the final score: [`https://data.nba.net/10s/prod/v1/20221018/scoreboard.json`](https://data.nba.net/10s/prod/v1/20221018/scoreboard.json) (yesterday's games)

It's also not showing full box score details for individual games: [`https://data.nba.net/data/10s/prod/v1/20221018/0022200001_boxscore.json`](https://data.nba.net/data/10s/prod/v1/20221018/0022200001_boxscore.json) (Celtics vs Sixers game)

Did the NBA change the request format or something? I also noticed that on the requests, at the top of the JSON, it says that the data was last updated Oct. 12th. I'm wondering if that's the issue.",Official NBA scores/stats API broken?
nba,"&gt; “From what I’ve heard talking to people, this iciness that you see in the media comments from Poole, saying, ‘You know, we’re professionals. I’ll leave it at that.’

&gt; “From Steve Kerr calling it the biggest crisis they've faced.”

&gt; “From Kevon Looney saying, ‘Draymond is going to have to earn our trust.’

&gt; If anything, I think that may be underplaying the level of iciness and tension that they’re navigating right now. And that’s not to say ‘Are they going to trade Draymond?’ Everything I’ve heard is they are not trading Draymond. They’re just not going to happen. They’re trying to win the championship and will try to ride it out unless something drastic happens. Draymond is going to be on the team all season.”

And even then, when Kyrie Irving was drafted by the Cavaliers in 2011, they were SUPPOSED to have one nationally televised game against the Miami Heat on 11/18/11, but this was obviously canceled due to the Lockout which led to the Cavs having zero national games that year.

I believe one or all of these players could’ve been better protected and could’ve had better careers. Obviously, PG is still a star. Livingston was an excellent midrange shooter and ball handler but he was projected to be a star before his injury. Hayward was never the same after his injury. He was signed on as a star but that injury didn’t help him reach his ceiling.

nba,"The NBA season has arrived and brings with it all of the excitement and energy of a new year. For a community on reddit, that, of course, also means a tremendous surge in activity. Accordingly, we are opening applications for a new batch of moderators to assist us in continuing to operate the sub at a level of quality we're satisfied with.

But before we get into the nitty-gritty of the moderator application itself, we feel it is also a good time to shed some transparency on certain factors behind the scenes that have driven the need for new moderators a little further.

r/NBA is now a community of over 5 million users. While we are so excited about that growth, it also comes with a very heavy load of moderation required to keep things organized and livable for the large majority of our users. Yesterday featured the first two games of the season and, as a result, there were nearly 3,000 moderator actions required just yesterday alone. As the season gets into gear and traffic in the subreddit picks up, that number will grow exponentially. These mod actions largely consist of reviewing user reports, removing inappropriate or inciting comments and responding to your modmails. While a large percentage of moderator actions are conducted by our trusty bots (such as immediately filtering out comments with slurs or exceedingly toxic language), even the smaller percentage of actions that the human mods are tasked with managing wind up in the hundreds to thousands each day. And the actions that we cannot automate (like responding to modmail) obviously take the largest amount of time.

Moderators, no matter how large the community, are not compensated in any way and this is an entirely voluntary role. Sometimes that also means that moderators may burn out or decide to move on because they've just gotten busy elsewhere. On that note, we've had a number of veteran mods step down from modding today, and step up to greater things:

* u/iamtheraptor - Not a Raptors fan, but a dinosour of our mod team, former #2 on the modlist, and resident Bucks fan
* u/DoesNotChodeWell - Actually a Raptors fan, with the oversight from The North we needed
* u/widesheep - Secretly a Hawks fan masquerading as a Hawks fan and former ""popular mod""
* u/howser343 - Greatly carried a lot of the recent updates and workload to make the sub more user friendly in recent years as we added millions of new fans, Bulls enthusiast
* u/thetrain23 - Our last resident Thunder fan deserves applause as loud as the thunderous roar of a train

Over the years they have all contributed greatly to this sub and community. We hope you'll join us in thanking them for the time and effort to make this sub amazing. They all truly deserve it. 


More recently, u/howser343 in particular was taking on a heavy load of our modding duties. As a result of the recent resignation, the adjustment period we are currently under, and the start of the season, please bear with us if things like mod mail responses aren't as quick as you are used to. A new round of moderator recruitment should hopefully help us get on track to the same efficiency that has been established in those areas already.

With that being said, here is a breakdown of the moderator application. If you are interested in joining the team, simply follow the guidelines below and respond to this thread with your application.

#FAQs

**What does a mod do?**

Review new submissions, assess user reports, moderate higher-conflict comment sections, respond to mod mail, update sidebar picture.

**How much work is it?**

It's not no work, while it's also not meant to take up too muchh of your time. The idea is that this is stuff you can handle while browsing the sub and naturally being a part of the community.

**Why would I want to mod?**

Modding is best suited for active users of the subreddit that want to pitch in to improve things. This is a huge and influential community and platform, and you get to contribute to continuing to make it great.

**What do I need in order to mod?**

A computer, a reddit account with 2FA active, and a Discord so you can be in communication with the rest of the team.

I'll spare the overly long intro from the first time and give this abbreviated version- starting in 1960, this series looks to go through the history of the NBA and revote on the hall of fame classes, while adopting the rules from baseball's hall of fame. (10 years on the ballot, 75%+ for induction, less than 5% and you're off.) Every voter is free to apply their own standards- you can care about or disregard character, college accomplishments or international ones. I'll provide very very limited summaries of player's accomplishments if you decide you want to read through it... or not! Most of us aren't super familiar with the 50's/60's game. If you want to read my ramblings in a little more detail, [here's the link to the original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/x8h29g/hall_of_fame_doover_starting_in_1960_how_would/). The mods got back to me and gave me a thumbs up, so I'll try to post the new ballot every Monday, Wednesday and Friday if you want to try to keep up and have your uh very important voice on very old NBA players be heard.

#Class of 1977

Leading the way in today's vote is a newcomer! Legendary defender **Nate Thurmond** cruises into our hall of fame on his first ballot, getting 94.1% of the vote in the process. But we have a second inductee as well! Sixers and ABA star **Billy Cunningham** joins the hall on his second ballot, slipping in with 76.5% of the vote. No one else came particularly close- Richie Guerin was the best of the rest, collecting 52.9% of the vote.

With the expansive class, there was also an expansive list of first timers disappearing. Wave good-bye to Bob Weiss, Fred Carter, Fred Foster, Herm Gilliam, Jack Marin, Jim Barnett, Keith Erickson, Mike Riordan, Neal Walk and Otto Moore. And others, having gotten by barely on their first ballot, finally slip off this time- Barry Clemens, Geoff Petrie, LeRoy Ellis and Mel Counts all exit.

One of the more interesting, forgotten players of NBA history- an excellent passer for a center, teammates such as Bob Love and Artis Gilmore calling him one of the greatest big man passers of all time. His assists per game were actually fairly similar to contemporary Bill Walton!

**Zaid Abdul-Aziz:** Center.

nba,"Basketball is an incredibly unique sport and in my opinion the most fun to watch, and as a fan of the big four American sports leagues (NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL) I haven't seen individual players criticized as much as NBA players are. I believe it's due to the format of the sport. In the NFL there are 22 players on the field at a time, so if the QB isn't responsible for a loss it's usually the offense or defense as a whole that takes the blame. Baseball is truly a team sport where you need high level players all through the roster or you won't succeed, unlike basketball where one added player can make you a contender. Hockey is so focused on passing that players can't really ""ISO"" and run an offense and take over a game. Another facet these three leagues have is that there are players or phases specifically for defense. Baseball has players play offense and defense but they have to transition between each half inning. Football and hockey have players specifically for defense.

So after all this rambling, I think that basketball players are the easiest to target and criticize for a few reasons. Firstly, they have the responsibility of both offense and defense and only have a couple of seconds to shift between those modes. Secondly, basketball is the easiest sport for a superstar to take over and succeed. A good QB, a good right fielder, or a good hockey forward can all be generational but can't carry a bad team the same way a basketball star can. Finally, basketball is the highest scoring sport of these four, where practically every player on the court is expected to score points, as opposed to the other sports which again have offensive and defensive positions. Sorry if this rambled for a bit, but it's been on my mind for a while on why, perhaps outside of quarterbacks, basketball players receive this highest criticisms from fans and media together. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this and even your disagreements!",Do you think the format of basketball leads to higher criticism?

&gt; CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Charlotte Hornets guard James Bouknight was found intoxicated and unconscious and holding a gun with his vehicle in drive before he was arrested on Sunday morning on DWI charges, according to Charlotte Mecklenburg County Police.

&gt; Police said they responded to reports that a person was passed out in his vehicle in a Charlotte parking lot Sunday morning, blocking the traffic way.

&gt; According to the police report, officers saw Bouknight, 22, unconscious inside the vehicle with the vehicle running and in drive. He had the handgun in his hands. Officers set up a perimeter and attempted to awaken Bouknight for approximately an hour using a public address system, blasting airhorns and using lights.

&gt; Police said that once Bouknight was awake, he refused to comply with commands and appeared confused for several minutes. They said he ate food inside his vehicle and then crashed into two police cars -- one of front of him and another behind him.

&gt; Bouknight eventually exited the vehicle and was detained.

&gt; Bouknight stated at the scene that he had approximately four tequila shots prior to driving home, the report said.

&gt; Bouknight was given a bond of $2,500.

&gt; ""I just want to apologize for being a distraction before the start of the season for my teammates and what we've got going on,"" Bouknight said Tuesday.

\#	|	Team	|	Δ	|	Record	|	Comment	|
--: 	|	:--	|	:--	|	:-:	|	:--	|
1	|	[](/GSW) Warriors	|		|	0-0	|	It was a quiet off season after the Championship until Draymond superman punched Poole. Fights appears to be common in the league but the video leak does make this one seem different. We will see if it tears the Warriors apart or maybe it invigorates them. Outside of this drama the Warriors off season had little off season movement outside of losing a couple key role players in OPJ and GPII. Warriors are hoping these minutes can be replaced by a combination of their young prospects and a couple new role players in JaMychal Green and Donte DiVincenzo.	|
2	|	[](/MIL) Bucks	|		|	0-0	|	After coming up short of defending their title in the '22 Playoffs, the Bucks are back with basically the exact same team as last year and should still be among the favorites to win the 'chip -- the only notable changes being the loss of lead assistant Darvin Ham who took over as HC of the Lakers and the additions of 24th pick Marjon Beauchamp (a defensive-minded wing), and free-agent-signee Joe Ingles (who will miss the first half-ish of the season due to injury). Khris Middleton and Pat Connaughton will also miss the start of the season due to injury so the first month or so of the season could be a challenge depth-wise. The story of the preseason/camp has been the terrific play of Jevon Carter who has seemingly secured the backup PG role over George Hill and looks likely to take Grayson Allen's starting spot if he sustains this level of play in the regular season. Some other things to watch for are, if Giannis' free throw % continues to improve (he shot 84% in eurobasket), if Brook Lopez's mobility gets even worse (he seems extra slow this preseason), and if any of Sandro Mamukelashvili, Jordan Nwora, or Beauchamp can break into the rotation (probably not).	|
3	|	[](/BOS) Celtics	|		|	0-0	|	The Celtics offseason was about as eventful as possible without actually losing anyone to free agency. They should be rocking and rolling into this season, but instead they're limping in. Ime Udoka is suspended for the season and presumably gone, Robert Williams is out for at least the first month of the season due to knee surgery, Danilo Gallinari tore his meniscus and is likely out for the season, Malcolm Brogdon is dealing with a sore knee, and Jaylen Brown appears to be slowly following in Kyrie's footsteps. This team is a complete question mark. On paper they should be one of the top contenders in the league. In reality, they could be in for another slow start to the season as they adjust and recover.	|
4	|	[](/DEN) Nuggets	|		|	0-0	|	Gather around, children, as we start reading the story of the 2023 NBA champion Denver Nuggets. Is this blind optimism? Yes. Will NuggLife strike once again and foil our championship aspirations? Possible, if not likely. However, with Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. finally returning from their long recoveries (giving our fat, sloppy, reigning back-to-back MVP some much needed help), a reloaded bench unit led by Bruce Brown and Bones Hyland, the starting lineup swap of Will Barton for [Kentavious Caldwell-Poop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNe-d3cnQnQ), and most importantly, the signing of MVP frontrunner DeAndre Jordan, this Nuggets squad on paper looks stronger than the bubble squad which made a Conference Finals appearance in 2020. Championship aspirations are in the air around Denver, still riding the high from their sibling hockey team winning the Cup last year, but NuggLife still looms in the shadows, waiting to strike. Is this the year that NuggLife is slain once and for all?	|
5	|	[](/PHI) 76ers	|		|	0-0	|	The Sixers might be one of the most highly anticipated teams of the entire season. With a completely revamped roster based on ""dawg mentality,"" the Sixers have finally filled in one of their greatest needs; rebounding and defense. PJ Tucker might be a few months from collecting social security checks, but his ability to defend and still splash 3s from the corner can be a huge addition to this team. With slim Harden, an even more emboldended Maxey, and Embiid (who will finally win MVP), the Sixers have clearly earned the position of being in the ""championship contender"" tier.	|
6	|	[](/LAC) Clippers	|		|	0-0	|	It's been a while since the whole gangs been back together. Halfway through last season we acquired some pretty big contributors who didn't have the chance to really blend with the entire team. With a good backup PG, some new great shooting, and hopefully the same great talent everyone's been hyped about, I'm looking forward to a good season.	|
8	|	[](/MEM) Grizzlies	|		|	0-0	|	This is the year that we've been building for. We finally have all our great role players to build around our star player who is finally thrusted into the starting line up. That's right, it's the season of Santi ""3rd highest single game +/- in NBA history"" Aldama who will be seeing significant minutes in the absence of JJJ. He's looked fantastic in the summer league and preseason from three and as long as he can be competent on defense he could open the floor for Ja in ways that come second to only Desmond Bane.	|
8	|	[](/PHX) Suns	|		|	0-0	|	The Suns are hoping the offensive presence of Cam Johnson will offset the lost defense from Jay Crowder. Last season the Suns had the 5th ranked offense and 3rd ranked defense. A swap of those would be a success. Just gotta figure out this bench...	|
9	|	[](/MIA) Heat	|		|	0-0	|	Another season full of hopes and dreams has arrived. I'm sure everyone's got their own hopes for the Miami Heat this year but the main thing I want is some players to take the next step. Our depth is weaker than past years but the roster is still capable to make noise in the East and maybe compete in the ECF. Tyler Herro got paid this offseason which should be good but the Heat did not do anything noteworthy outside of that. We drafted Nikola Jovic who seems to be a promising player but we have always had a tendency to trade young guys for contributors today so too risky to get attached to what he could be. Although things can get pretty dicey especially with the lack of investment in new players. Expectation for the season is playoffs between 4th and 7th seed and making the 2nd round of the playoffs at a minimum. Only time will tell if it happens but at least we've had a good stretch of not missing playoffs to help support the idea that we'll get there once again (last time we missed playoffs was 2019 and looking at the roster that year it makes sense why we missed it). [Let's go Heat!](https://www.wishtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/burnie-e1457358319822_39595483_ver1.0.jpg)	|
10	|	[](/DAL) Mavericks	|		|	0-0	|	The Mavericks are putting out a bokld strategy for the 2022-23 season following Luka Doncic's most successful season: Let Luka Doncic run the team entirely, and surround him with role players to make his job &amp; life easier every night. Losing Jalen Brunson puts a lot of responsibility on Spencer Dinwiddie's shoulders, and new center Christian Wood is the most unique big man Luka Doncic has played with in his NBA career. Can the Mavs' unconventional approach get them safely out of the play-in game? One key thing to look for is how the Mavs start the season. Last year, they tried implementing Igor Kokoskov's offense for the first few months, but shifted towards a different approach before finding their rhythm. Having early-season success and staying healthy will be key swing factors for this Mavs team in 2023.	|
11	|	[](/BKN) Nets	|		|	0-0	|	It's crazy the NBA totally cancelled all of last year but I had this weird dream that the Nets devolved into a dysfunctional amalgamation of big egos and toxic communication. Ah well, it's a fresh season now and the Nets actually have pieces that fit together. KD is still one of the best players in the league and Kyrie is still a incredible shot maker that can't keep his opinions to himself - they combine into one of the most exciting duos in the game today. The biggest X-factor potentially in the entire NBA is Ben Simmons - how will he play alongside a seemingly perfect group of players that will allow him to utilize his strengths? He will be surrounded by shooters aside from Claxton but their defensive potential together is exciting. Royce O'Neale already looks like an amazing acquisition for the team and while Markieff Morris isn't popular, he will be a much needed voice of reason throughout the year. 	|
12	|	[](/MIN) TWolves	|		|	0-0	|	Wolves made some moves this offseason. The Wolves backcourt of Rudy Gobert and KAT looks to bring two towers to the Twin Cities. On paper it's clear Gobert's presense will be a godsend among the offensive minded young TWolves players. Outside of the core 4 the Wolves will be looking at new acquisitions Kyle Anderson, Bryn Forbes and Austin Rivers, as well as rookie Wendell Carter and third year Jaden McDaniels to provide production off the bench.	|
13	|	[](/CLE) Cavaliers	|		|	0-0	|	The Cleveland Cavaliers were the 3 seed in the East at the 2022 all-star break. An injury plague would cause the Cavs to finish the season 9-15 after the all-star break while giving up 11 PPG more than pre-break, before being eliminated with losses to BKN &amp; ATL in the play-in. Losing allowed us to retain the FRP we sent for LeVert, which was used to draft Ochai Agbaji. Koby Altman then utilized him, RFA Collin Sexton and Lauri Markkanen to acquire Donovan Mitchell. As a result, the Cavaliers will be fielding the same team that showed enough to be the 3 seed at the all-star break, but -Markkanen, +Mitchell. That, plus regaining Ricky Rubio, led the NBA GMs to choose the Cavaliers as the team with the best overall offseason moves. Mitchell brings something that the Cavs did not have outside of Darius Garland last year, a trigger happy, ball dominant guard. Garland shot 6 3PA/g, and no other guard shot more than 3 3PA/g for us.. while Mitchell fired off 10 3PA/g last season. JB has mentioned running Spida at the 1 when Garland is resting until the return of Rubio, and our deep rotation will all have a chance to contribute and compliment Spidaland/Frobley. It is very likely that either LeVert or Okoro will take turns starting at the 3, but you can certainly expect more tall ball as there have been whispers of Mobley sliding down to put out an end-of-game lineup of Garland, Mitchell, Mobley, Love and Allen. 	|
14	|	[](/ATL) Hawks	|		|	0-0	|	Much like last season, the success of the Hawks will be almost entirely determined by their defense. Another season of being top 5 on the offensive end of the floor and bottom 5 on the defensive end isn't going to cut it. Bringing in Dejounte Murray as the new primary point of attack defender is certainly going to help with that, but Clint Capela returning to the form he had two seasons ago is probably even more important than that. De'Andre Hunter also needs to take a big step in his development and show why the Hawks traded up to draft him 4th overall. If everything breaks right for the Hawks, their ceiling is a top 3 seed in the east and their floor is a play-in game. With most of the Eastern Conference being much improved, expect the Hawks to land somewhere in the middle. 	|
15	|	[](/TOR) Raptors	|		|	0-0	|	The raptors off-season went about as boring as it could, although perhaps for the best. While rumours existed at times, ultimately the team decided not to pursue any large trades, and focus on internal development. A lot of the success this year depends on the growth of Scottie Barnes (will he hit a sophomore wall?), Precious Achiuwa (is his shooting stroke a fluke, and can he improve his finishing ability?), and Dalano Banton (are his improved handles and ability to run a second unit in preseason going to transfer to the regular season?). Last year the raptors also struggled heavily with their bench contributions and injuries. Pickups of Otto Porter Jr, healthy Khem Birch, and a full season of Thad Young should help tremendously. There’s also a potentially interesting rookie in Christian Koloko, who could play a valuable bench role as our only 7 footer. Ultimately this season will rely heavily once again on the health of our starting five, the ability of new players to get used to the switch heavy defensive schemes we run, and improvements (if possible) to our half court offensive system. At the end of the year, most raptors fans would likely be happy with making the second round of the playoffs.	|
16	|	[](/NOP) Pelicans	|		|	0-0	|	It's time. The bell gongs. The fat man has returned (no, not one of the many tourists trolling Bourbon past their bed time). The bloody mary's been made, the gumbo's a-cookin', the second line rolls down the street. Willie Green has been in a hunting shack deeeeeep in the bayou meditating, reaching his second form. Naruto has been read through three times each by everyone on staff. SASUKEEEEEEEEE! the bell gongs again, but this time it sounds eerily like the Natchez' organ. Baby King Cake arises from solitary confinement below Tipitina's. All make their way to the Blender, as the dawn rises from their final Bender before the season. Suit Up, Bow Down, and let's dance. The Pelicans are coming for your children, and Alvardo to commit Grand Theft Auto. I'm absolutely buzzing, let's ride. 	|
17	|	[](/CHI) Bulls	|		|	0-0	|	Let's get hype, Chicago! The healthy version of this year's team is an improvement over the healthy version of last year's team. We're waiting on Lonzo Ball to return to action and form DeBallZach (and to see how severe this lingering issue is), for year two of Trying. Year TWO. Given the potential we showed in the early-mid season I'm quite shocked people have soured so quickly on the Bulls. DeMVP and Zach are still here, Pat Williams and Caruso are returning, Ayo and Javonte have taken another step, and we got veteran signings Andre Drummond and Goran Dragic to fill us out. I'm ready to sit back and enjoy the ride of a Contending Chicago Sports Team!	|
18	|	[](/LAL) Lakers	|		|	0-0	|	For a off-season filled with trade rumors on Westbrook, specially followng the acquistion of Pat Bev. It's shocking that the team is staying put with this 'Big 3'. The team has gotten younger and athletic and it shows on the court, not that its a high bar from last year's catastrophe. However, wing defense and shooting is still a concern. The centers don't seem serviceable as advertised,  the team has too much guards including a late signing of Schroder, Darvin Ham even tested bringing Russ off the bench, who coincidentially(or not) injured his hamstring. A new head coach and the younger talent may pack some more fight and wins this year compared to last year's, however barring a carry job from LeBron-AD and/or a trade that brings in some talent to this roster, the ceiling seems to be a play-in spot in a packed Western Conference. It would be genuinely promising if they somehow stay at .500 or above through the first 10 games.	|
19	|	[](/POR) Trail Blazers	|		|	0-0	|	The roster is new and shiny, and probably the most talented that Dame has had since Aldridge left town. After an off-season of excitement, though, pre-season has left a lot of fans worried about this new squad. Despite adding Grant and GPII are they still terrible at defense? Are they really starting a three guard lineup again? 	|
20	|	[](/NYK) Knicks	|		|	0-0	|	""A wise man teaches a man to fish. A wiser man teaches a man to fish and also gives him a fish."" The Knicks have made the wiser man's move, much to the chagrin of the media vultures who circle us like some great beached whale. Instead of sinking cost and mortgaging our youth in the inflated Donoval Mitchell sweepstakes, we bought ourselves a most precious and rare feature to grace the Garden's court-  the efficient Point Guard. At a more than reasonable salary, Jalen Brunson has joined a team which has had a hole in his exact shape and size for over two decades. Far be it from me to call him a Silver Bullet however, as no team has an *I* in it: RJ Barrett, the Duke of York, is leading a team that seems overflowing with potential. Should his shot keep falling consistently, and should he improve underneath the basket, the skillsets of the rest of the team will flourish. Already we've seen Obi Toppin and Mitchell Robinson show off in the preseason, with Obi's newly revealed all-around game and Mitch's continued defensive dominance being key points in our victories. Immanuel Quickley, saved from lead guard responsibilities by Brunson's arrival, is able to focus on his combo-guard brilliance that has made him the darling of NBA Stat Nerds the coutry over. Evan Fournier, perhaps the best long-range shooter the Knicks have ever had, finds himself in a unique position with 3-and-D hype train Quentin Grimes hot on his heels. By all accounts my French Countryman is graciously teaching Grimes all that he should know, placing the team first in the inevitable case that Grimes wrestles the lead Shooting Guard position away from Fournier in the near future. And I'd be truly remiss (and hunted by a certain phophet of Jokic) if I did not mention Isaiah Hartenstein, who is a spacing, rim protecting big with court vision that the Knicks haven't had since, I don't know, David Lee? Oh yeah, and D Rose is back. Hope he gets the 6MOY award with us that he's deserved for quite some time now. Let's see, let's see, we've gone through Brunson, the youngsters, Fournier... Ah right. The 250-lb Elephant in the Room... Julius Randle is one of the most interesting cases I've ever seen as a Knicks fan. He joins the team as a less-than-sonsolaiton prize for KD and Kyrie, plays badly, then comes back the following year in one of the most inspired MIP campaigns I've ever seen, gripping the adulation of New York fans and willing what should by all means be a bad team to a high playoff seeding, only to lose in the first round to sheer talent. A cinderellla story. Then, disaster. A poor attitude to strat the season led to the poorest choice a New York athlete could make... antagonizing the fans. And the season never really recovered from there. Body language issues, lack of present leadership, and a quick temper spearheaded a disappointing season. That said, I have not lost faith in Julius. His issues last season were those of someone who cares too much, not too little. The passion and volition to win are present- and now that we have a legitimate Point Guard for the first time in Randle's tenure we should finally see what he's like as an efficient player not trying to do to much with the ball in his hands.To all my fellow fans, I wish you all a great season filled with pleasant surprise, a high level of competition and that inimitable New York spirit. To all the rest, *Bing Bong*	|
21	|	[](/SAC) Kings	|		|	0-0	|	Once again, the Sacramento Kings finish preseason with a 4-0 record! Will the off-season pickups change the losing course that typically follows? Under Mike Brown this roster appears to have bought into the defensive mentality and fast paced offense. Concerns heading into the season is size, currently this roster is unequipped to handle some of the bigger rosters. This team is capable of countering size with speed and shooting as this is one of the most balanced rosters fans have seen in years. All eyes are on NBA Summer league MVP rookie sensation Keegan Murray who offers both size and versatility. Although it looks like he is destined to come off the bench to start the season his minutes will most likely mirror that of most of the starters. Kings fans are ready to end this 16-year playoff drought and hoping this team supplies the rain.	|
22	|	[](/CHA) Hornets	|		|	0-0	|	The Hornets are poised for a terrible season. We had the coach drama thing and the Miles Bridges arrest and subsequent indefinite suspension. We will eventually have the Hayward injury thing, and we persistently have the ""who is our starting center / let's draft 3 more and see if someone's actually good"" thing. It's a team at rock bottom that's stashing a generational talent in LaMelo Ball. Some Hornets fans may not want to admit it, but this season is all about tanking for a second young star to pair with Lamelo. The future may be bright, but the present is so, so dark. 	|
23	|	[](/WAS) Wizards	|		|	0-0	|	It is that time of the year where the Wizards fans tell themselves, ""You know what, I don't hate this line-up."" There is a lot to the Wizards that makes them a potential ""good regular season"" team -- the forgotten incredible scorer who isn't coming off of a knee injury, very good talent in the wing position, presentable point guards and depth at the five. Rui Hachimura is going to be playing for a contract this season and could finally have his breakout year. It is also the first real off-season for a first time head coach in Wes Unseld Jr and he finally has the team to get his structure set. The Wizards will not be a contender but if they don't tank for Victor Wembanyama (or the equally incredible Scoot Henderson who probably will be the better immediate player given the reality of what a guard can accomplish right away versus a center), they'll more than likely be an easy play-in lock. This season likely will be the continuation of what has been frustration since the House of Guards era. But hopefully, it might just be a little more entertaining this time around. 	|
24	|	[](/DET) Pistons	|		|	0-0	|	Our preseason was uninspiring. However we did have many vet injuries (already) in new acquisitions of Nerlens Noel and Alec Burks as well as holdovers Hamidou Diallo and now Marvin Bagley. Our core roster, regardless of the vets, is still raw and learning to play within their roles. There will be some flashiness mixed with growing pains from Jaden Ivey. He has shown in preseason the different gears that he has to work with and can get to the lane with ease to help open up a sputtering offense. Jalen Duren will probably be eased into our offense more slowly, but is an athletic rim runner who can rebound which should find him some minutes early on. Beef Stef has a 3 point shot now (evidenced by him showing out with 4-10 in our last preseason game - his previous season high was 63 total attempts from deep). Killian Hayes looks like he belongs in the NBA based on the preseason! Look for this team to have many growing pains that will ultimately hinge on the efficiency of Saddiq Bey and Cade. We will very likely be in the Victor Wembanyama sweepstakes.	|
27	|	[](/HOU) Rockets	|		|	0-0	|	It is yet too early to be collecting dividends from the rebuild. With the trade of Christian Wood, and the likely departure of Eric Gordon at the trade deadline, the team will be leaning even further on the young core for this season. In theory, Sengun and Green should take a step up in their second year, but without the vets, it's unlikely that the team will improve that much overall. The expectation is a small step forward, but not a big leap.	|
27	|	[](/IND) Pacers	|		|	0-0	|	Well, the Pacers certainly find themselves in uncharted waters heading into the 2022-23 season. After decades of mediocre-at-the-absolute-minimum basketball, Indiana finally has embraced the tank, and looks to let the youth movement reign supreme with Tyrese Haliburton running the show. Rookie Bennedict Mathurin has looked excellent in both the Summer League and preseason; could the Pacers accidentally win too many games and remove themselves from the Wembanyama sweepstakes?	|
27	|	[](/ORL) Magic	|		|	0-0	|	Drafting Paolo has the fandom buzzing with excitement. Along with Wendell and Franz having strong showings during the preseason, the Magic's future in the frontcourt looks bright. With continued growth from Coach Mose and the rest of the roster, don't be surprised if the Magic make a run for the playoffs. And maybe with a little bit of success comes the often rumored rebrand?	|
28	|	[](/UTA) Jazz	|		|	0-0	|	9910 points. That’s how many points Jazz players scored last season as a team. 3157 points. That’s how many points were scored last season by Jazz players that are still on the team’s roster. The Utah Jazz enter a new era after a dramatic off-season which saw them trade All-Stars Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell for a return of 7 first round picks, 3 first round pick swaps, 2 first round draftees and 7 other players. The commitment to a rebuild will be an adjustment period for the franchise who has won at least 40 games in 35 of the last 38 years with the new vision a stark difference from years prior. Players to watch for this season include Lauri Markkanen, fresh off a EuroBasket tournament where he averaged 28/8 on 54/41/91 splits for Finland and Collin Sexton who will look to prove himself after a season on the sidelines through injury. Ultimately though, there’s only one goal for the Jazz truly this season: Tank for the Lank, Play Bad for the French Lad, Win mañana for Wembanyana	|
29	|	[](/OKC) Thunder	|		|	0-0	|	Despite Chet Holmgren being out for the season - the Thunder have A LOT to be excited about. Preseason was a very impressive showing from the new rookies and veteran (lol) sophomores. Another year of improvement for the rest of the guys with Coach Daig at the helm will do wonders for cohesion. Expect the Thunder to be a surprisingly good defensive team. 	|
30	|	[](/SAS) Spurs	|		|	0-0	|	I am under no delusions this year; we are going to be B-A-D bad. However, I think I'm going to have a lot of fun watching the young guys develop. Keldon has dropped 20 lbs and is finally playing his natural position at the 3 and has looked much more comfortable on offense and defense during the preseason. Vassell looks like he's taken a leap, and Primo has shown flashes. Additionally, the Spurs' No. 9 pick, Jeremy Sochan, is the second coming of Dennis Rodman and already looks to be one of the players you love to have on your team and hate to play against. He'll be slotting into the starting 5 with the aforementioned wings, Tre Jones at PG and Jakob Poeltl at C (likely midseason trade-bait). There won't be too many high points this season if it goes as everyone expects, so I'm going to use these writeups to say something nice about a different player on the team every ranking. Buckle up Spurs fans, we're officially in the tank now.	|",Official /r/nba Power Rankings #0 (10.19.2022)

We probably won’t see Klay get any scoring titles, it’s just not his role. 
But like Manu Ginobli (who also should be on the list) his on the court and locker room contributions to championship basketball can’t be denied.

There’s no way Melo should be top 75 over Klay.

Mamukelashvili, naturally outgoing with a gregarious personality, quickly found himself trying to fit in to match the energy of his teammates. So, he started talking and joking around, but in his excitement, he made a big mistake.

“He started talking s— to me,” Antetokounmpo recalled in a hallway of Fiserv Forum last Saturday, following the Bucks’ open scrimmage.

One year later, the memory was still quite vivid in Antetokounmpo’s head.

“He said, ‘Yo, Giannis, I’m gonna shut you down in practice today.’ and I was just tying my shoe, but he did not know me,” Antetokounmpo told The Athletic. “It was like our first interaction, first time to meet somebody, but he didn’t know me. And he is like a kid that has so much energy, he loves to talk too much. He was like, ‘I’m gonna shut you down today. I’m going to bust your ass.’ And I was just tying my shoes. And I can see Jrue, I can see Khris was like …”

…

The training camp anecdote serves as a tremendous reminder of what makes Antetokounmpo such a great player and the edge that he plays with every single day, as well as a word of warning for brash young players.

Unfortunately, that didn’t happen.

That story is completely fabricated.

Made up.

An invention in Antetokounmpo’s mind.

Mamukelashvili never said what Antetokounmpo claims he said. Mamukelashvili never cursed at Antetokounmpo. He didn’t tell Antetokounmpo he was going to shut him down the first day they ever practiced against each other. Mamukelashvili said something far more innocent in an attempt to appear confident and fit in with his teammates.

“Yeah, boy, I’m coming for you. Watch out,” Mamukelashvili recalled saying to Antetokounmpo.

Like Michael Jordan hearing something LaBradford Smith never said or Shaquille O’Neal lying to himself about David Robinson denying him an autograph as a teenager to fuel him in future matchups, Antetokounmpo embellished Mamukelashvili’s words in his mind to motivate himself on the floor. To Mamukelashvili, talking trash to the two-time MVP would have been unthinkable in the moment.

…

“I’m gonna say this — in my head, I don’t know if I did it in this situation — but in my head, sometimes I exaggerate things,” Antetokounmpo told The Athletic. “I make things in a way to make me, to fill me up with fuel, to get more. And maybe, it was one of those incidents.”

“But I remember he said something. Like, ‘Yo, I’m gonna shut you down today. You’re not gonna score on me.’ Something like that, but I didn’t say a word to him. But the whole time I was lifting, all I could think about was those words. ‘I’m going to shut you down, man. I’m going to do this, that.’ But Mamu doesn’t know that. And that’s when you strike them. When they’re not ready. They think that moment has passed, but it hasn’t. It’s coming right back.”",A very interesting anecdote from Giannis’s 1-on-1 sit down with The Athletic’s reporter Eric Nehm

If you count games on NBATV, the Lakers have 39 nationally televised games. They have 27 without. They’re going to be not great again. Probably, pretty bad. A lot of those games are going to be 15-20 point blowouts. 

Why does the NBA force big market bad basketball down our throats? They always shy away from showing their best products and then wonder why a Wolves, Pels or Grizz game doesn’t get good ratings. Maybe because they don’t market their stars well enough?

Conversely, I feel the NFL makes sure to show their best product. They put the Chiefs, Bills Tampa Bay, etc all in prominent TV slots. All small markets. The product is good and people show up to watch. I feel like I never am shown too many Giants games just because the market is so large. I don’t remember seeing a ton of Raiders games when they sucked in LA. I see a ton of Patrick Mahomes or Josh Allen games. A lot of Lamar Jackson games as well.

Is basketball so far behind the NFL in popularity that it is just a completely regional game? I don’t know why else the league wouldn’t just give the Lakers a reasonable number of games.

&gt;During the 2003/04 NBA season, Pippen played 23 games with the Chicago Bulls, but none of them was against the Cleveland Cavaliers. They clashed 4 times during that season, twice in December and twice in March. He played his last game in February against the Seattle Supersonics, so was unable to face the Cavs in March. 
&gt;
&gt;However, he could have done it in December, but a left knee made it impossible for him. On December 12, Scottie underwent arthroscopic surgery on that knee and was sidelined for several weeks. 

For the record LeBron has played against 6 father and son duos

&gt;Bron has battled against Gary Payton and Gary Payton II, Kenyon Martin and Kenyon Martin Jr., Gary Trent and Gary Trent Jr., Rick Brunson and Jalen Brunson, Glenn Robinson and Glenn Robinson III, and Glen Rice and Glen Rice Jr.",Lebron almost played against Scottie Pippen in his rookie season.

nba,"So when Embiid first started playing in the league, he was a defensive juggernaut. Very few players could score on him in the post, and you could argue he was the second-best center on defense, just behind Gobert. He has been the defensive anchor for the Sixers, and the team has usually had a top defense with him playing. 

However, in the second half of last season, and now after the first game this year, defense no longer seems to be Embiid's strongpoint. He's pretty passive on defense these days and isn't nearly as nimble on his feet on defense. He seems to only do the bare minimum defending the post and sometimes will let defenders just go right by him. 

So has Embiid regressed from a great defender to just an average defender?",Has Joel Embiid regressed on defense?

Play happened at the end of the 4th quarter of the Sixers Celtics game. James Harden enters a shooting motion but very quickly passes it off to Tucker who flips the shot up for a made field goal. Initially marked an assist but changed post game with no explanation. 

“An assist is awarded only if the last player’s pass contributed directly to a made basket. An assist can be awarded for a basket scored after the ball has been dribbled if the player’s pass led to the field goal being made.”",Is this Harden play an assist?

nba,"So i'm from argentina, and i go to bed pretty early. This would be my third season using the NBA pass and what i usually do is put some games in the background at my office computer the next day, and the games i wouldn't really watch i just put on the highlights. The problem with this is:

 \- there's no ""highlights"" option inside watching the game, so you can't access to it spoiler-free. There is a ""game recap"" option but is hidden if you hide scores, and also seems to be way shorter than last years. (Last night games had 2/3 mins game recaps when last years was around 8/10 mins)

\- there's no quality options, so i can't even watch those at good fps in the shit computer i have at work (that's my issue i know, but i think having quality options is a pretty basic feature to have)

All had/have insane careers. Many championships, efficient, leaders, etc.

Wilt, Shaq: The two most dominant non Top 4 players ever. Kobe doesn’t hold a candle to these guys in terms of dominant all around performances. See: 2000-02 finals and (every insane Wilt feat).

Bird, Magic, Duncan: More efficient than Kobe. More “best player on championship teams” than Kobe. Most of these guys did more with less too. Kevin McHale and Parker/ginobli were very good players, but they weren’t Shaq. Better leaders too.

So, Kobe in my book has AT BEST a shot at 10th. The problem is the competition. Hakeem was a more well rounded, efficient player. Imagine this: Kobe is drafted by Houston and Hakeem by LA. Hakeem does as well or better than Kobe. Kobe becomes Tmac. Right? Also, what about Steph? Much better leader, four chips out of nothing, insane eight year run of individual and team dominance (and counting), much more efficient offensive player. KD is knocking on the door too. More versatile. Better defender for longer. Better shooter. And I think we need to stop giving Kobe extra credit for forcing his way to ride on a prime Shaq LA team when KD got drafted by the Nonics/OKC bloodsucking liar owner team. (No offense to the great OKC fans. You should have an expansion team along with Vegas.) 

Here is the final nail in the coffin. Compare Wade to Kobe. Seriously, look it up. Their career numbers are very similar (ppg rpg apg). Wade obviously better at blocked shots. Obviously the better leader, won a championship by himself in a tough place to win (Miami with an old Shaq) and is the more efficient player. Kobe has the longevity card, so it’s close. If Dwayne Wade has a legit argument for being as good if not better than you, you are not top ten all time.

Thoughts? I’ll admit, I hate Kobe and mad respect Lebron, Hakeem, Duncan,  etc. That said, to me he sits at #11 just behind Steph, with KD nipping at his heels.",Kobe not top ten all time

I know everyone was calling him a bust, but he really proved to be the overall first round pick he was when he came into the league. I’m excited for this year! Also, having the big 3: Steph, Klay, and Dray starting the year healthy together for the first time in forever!!

I’m so excited for them to come out and kill it! The starters of Steph, Klay, Draymond, looney, and wiggins are gonna be ever better this year after having more time playing on the court together!",Andrew Wiggins is amazing &amp; Big 3 ❤️

Watching the opener between Philly and Boston just reminded of me of how frustrating it can be watching the games: players flopping, falling on the floor after nearly every shot, calling for fouls after every shot, whining at the refs when they are called for a foul, baiting fouls. Maybe it’s just those two teams that have players who are notorious for that. 

Any thoughts on how the league can manage this?",Are on the court antics making the game unwatchable?

Dear Dray

You still ain't recorded or posted, I hope you have a chance

I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't podcast for fans

If you don't wanna talk to Jordan outside your practice
 
You didn't have to, but you could've made an episode for Steven.A

That's my little brother, man, he's only fifty five years old

We waited in the blistering cold for you

For eleven days since the last episode 
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol

He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do

I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to

Remember when you met with Pat? you said if I'd listen would cast back...

Poole and Wiggins got paid, I'm wondering how 

Warriors have any money left at all 

No trade offers in the window (window)
And Dray can't extend at all

And even if he could it'd less than Andre 

But Schröder's picture on my wall

My personal feeling is, there is nothing he can do this season outside of something unrealistically ridiculous.

I was browsing the “NBA EU” website and almost made a purchase but seeing the ts&amp;cs I could see it was actually run by a company called “fanatic international”, which led me down a trust pilot rabbit hole, which led me to multiple 1 star reviews and now I’m stuck.

Would appreciate the tips and guidance.
